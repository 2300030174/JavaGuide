As the ancients said: "**The stone from another mountain can be used to polish jade**." Being good at learning from others' successful interview experiences or lessons from failures can help you avoid many detours.

In **[“Java Interview Guide”](../zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.md)** under the **“Interview Experience”** section, I share over 15 high-quality Java backend interview experiences, including those from campus recruitment, social recruitment, large companies, and small to medium-sized enterprises.

If you are a non-computer science major, you can also find interview experiences written by fellow non-CS students in these articles.

Additionally, [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) has a dedicated section for sharing interview experiences and questions, where many quality interview experiences and questions will be shared.

Compared to the interview experiences on Niuke.com or other websites, the interview experiences compiled in **“Java Interview Guide”** are of higher quality, and I will provide quality reference materials.

Many students might ask: “Why not just provide the specific answers directly?” The main reasons are as follows:

1. The reference materials provide more detailed explanations and also allow you to review related knowledge points.
1. The reference materials I provide are mostly my original work. If I want to improve the answers to interview questions later, I won’t need to modify each answer from previous interview experiences (as many interview questions are quite similar). Of course, my original articles may not cover every point in interviews, and for some interview questions, I have selected high-quality articles written by other tech bloggers, all of which are of high quality.
