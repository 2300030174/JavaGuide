title: What to Do If You Don't Have Internship Experience for Campus Recruitment?

Due to the highly competitive nature of current interviews, I personally suggest that whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student, you should strive for good internship opportunities before participating in campus recruitment interviews, especially internships at large companies. Both regular internships and summer internships are acceptable. Of course, if you can't secure an internship at a large company, internships at small and medium-sized companies are also acceptable.

However, finding internships is quite challenging now. Many students this year, including some from 211/985 universities, have not found internships.

If you really can't find a suitable internship, then there's nothing we can do. We should spend more time focusing on the following three things:

1. Strengthen project experience
1. Continuously improve your resume
1. Prepare for technical interviews

## Strengthen Project Experience

If you don't have internship experience for campus recruitment, it can be a disadvantage (it's just too competitive), so you need to put more effort into the project experience section to make up for it.

I recommend that you do your best to strengthen your project experience, improve existing projects, or work on more impressive projects to compensate as much as possible.

The focus of your interview will be on the knowledge points related to your project experience. If your project experience is relatively simple, the interviewer may not know what to ask. Additionally, knowledge points not covered in your project experience but mentioned in your skills introduction are also likely to be questioned. For example, skills like Redis are essential for Java backend positions, and I believe most interviewers will ask about them.

I recommend reading this article on the website: [Project Experience Guide](https://javaguide.cn/interview-preparation/project-experience-guide.html).

## **Improve Your Resume**

You must, must, must pay attention to your resume! I suggest spending at least 2-3 days specifically to improve your resume. Moreover, you should continue to refine it afterward.

When screening resumes, interviewers tend to focus on the following dimensions:

1. **Internship/Work Experience**: They look for good internship experiences, preferably at large companies and relevant to the position you are applying for.
1. **Awards**: If you have high-value awards (from well-known competitions like ACM or Alibaba Cloud Tianchi), it can be a plus, especially for campus recruitment, as such candidates are often sought after by large companies (but winning an award doesn't guarantee entry into a large company; interview performance still matters). For social recruitment, the impact of awards is relatively small, and past work experience and project experience are usually more important.
1. **Project Experience**: Project experience is very important for interviews, and interviewers will pay close attention to it. It is also a key area for advanced interview questions.
1. **Skill Match**: They will check if your skills meet the job requirements. Before submitting your resume, make sure that your skills introduction does not lack any skills required for the position you are applying for.
1. **Education**: Compared to other industries, the tolerance for educational background in programming job interviews is relatively high. As long as you excel in other areas, you can compensate for any shortcomings in your education. You should know that in many industries, such as law and finance, education is a key factor; if you don't meet the educational requirements, you won't even get an interview opportunity. However, as interviews become more competitive, some large companies, state-owned enterprises, and research institutes have started to set educational requirements, with many positions requiring 211/985 degrees or even a master's degree. In summary, education is hard to change; if you come from a less prestigious school, apply to companies that do not have strict educational requirements and work on improving your other hard skills.

For most job seekers, internship/work experience, project experience, and skill match are more important. However, some companies may still filter candidates based on education.

## **Prepare for Technical Interviews**

Before the interview, make sure to prepare for common interview questions, also known as the "eight-legged essay":

- What knowledge points might be involved in your interview, and which ones are key?
- What questions are frequently asked in interviews, and how should you answer them? (I strongly do not recommend rote memorization. First: How much can you remember through this method? How long can you remember it? Second: It's hard to maintain learning through rote memorization!)

Different types of companies have different focuses on skill requirements. For example, Tencent and ByteDance may place more emphasis
