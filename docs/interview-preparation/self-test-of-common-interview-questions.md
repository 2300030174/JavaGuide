Before the interview, it is highly recommended that everyone take common interview questions for self-assessment to check their grasp of the subject. This is a very practical technique for preparing for technical interviews.

In **[“Java Interview Guide”](../zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.md)**, under the section **“Technical Interview Questions Self-Assessment”**, I have summarized the most common interview questions related to the most important knowledge points in Java interviews and presented them in the format of interview questions.

For each self-assessment interview question, I provide an importance level, making it easier for everyone to choose selectively based on their circumstances when time is tight. Additionally, I will provide hints to help you recall the corresponding knowledge points.

If you really have no clue during the interview, a good interviewer will also give you hints.
