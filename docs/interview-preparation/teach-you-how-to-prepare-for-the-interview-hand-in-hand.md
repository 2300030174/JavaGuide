::: tip Friendly Reminder
This article is excerpted from **[《Java Interview Guide》](../zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.md)**. It is a column that teaches you how to prepare for interviews more efficiently, complementing the content of JavaGuide, covering common interview topics (system design, common frameworks, distributed systems, high concurrency, etc.), and high-quality interview experiences.

You must have many friends around you who are better at programming but haven't found a job as good as yours! **Technical interviews are different from programming; being good at programming does not guarantee success in technical interviews.**

If you go for an interview without serious preparation, it's like walking into the line of fire. Most of us are just ordinary people who haven't published in top journals or won top competition awards. In this technical interview atmosphere, we need to spend a lot of energy preparing for interviews to improve our technical abilities. “**Interviewing is like building rockets, while work is like tightening screws**” is currently a norm, and it is expected to remain so for a long time.

Preparing for an interview does not mean being clever or memorizing interview questions. **Do not have a fluke mentality about interviews. You must be strong yourself!** Never think that reading a few interview experiences or question analyses will guarantee you pass the interview. You must calm down and study deeply!

In this article, I will briefly discuss how to prepare for Java interviews from a macro perspective, helping you avoid detours!

## Start Learning with Job Orientation Early

I recommend that students still in school try to learn with job orientation as early as possible.

**This approach is more targeted and can significantly reduce the time spent in confusion, allowing you to avoid many detours.**

However! Do not interpret "learning with job orientation" as "I don't need to learn those basic computer courses in class"!

I have emphasized in many previous shares: **You must earnestly learn computer fundamentals! Operating systems, computer organization principles, and computer networks are indeed useful subjects!!!**

You will find that these topics will be relevant in interviews with large companies and in your future work. Here are two examples:

- **In interviews**: Technical interviews at major companies like ByteDance and Tencent, as well as almost all companies' written tests, will cover questions related to operating systems.
- **In work**: When using caching in practice, the concept of caching at the software level originates from the mismatch between database speed, Redis (in-memory middleware) speed, and local memory speed; in the design of computer storage hierarchy, we can also find similar issues and the use of caching concepts: memory is used to solve the problem of slow disk access speed, and CPUs use three levels of cache to alleviate the speed difference between registers and memory. They all face the same problem (speed mismatch) and the same concept, so the optimization measures for cache performance in storage hierarchy design by computer pioneers are also applicable to performance optimization of software-level caches.

**How to learn with job orientation?** In simple terms: organize a skill checklist for your target position based on job requirements, and then learn and improve according to that checklist.

1. First, clarify what job you are looking for.
1. Then, organize a skill checklist based on the job requirements.
1. Write a final resume based on the skill checklist.
1. Finally, learn and improve according to the requirements of the resume.

This is also an application of the **begin with the end in mind** philosophy.

**What does begin with the end in mind mean?** In simple terms, it means we can consider problems from the perspective of the result, starting from the result to determine what we need to do.

You will find that the **begin with the end in mind** philosophy can be applied in almost any field.

## Understand the Golden Time for Submitting Resumes

Before the interview, you must first clarify the specific times for spring recruitment and autumn recruitment.

As the saying goes, "golden March and silver April, golden September and silver October," if you miss this time, many companies will no longer have hiring quotas.

**Autumn recruitment generally starts in July and lasts until the end of September.**

**Spring recruitment generally starts in March and lasts until the end of April.**

Many companies (especially large ones) may not have hiring quotas by mid-September (autumn recruitment) or mid-March (spring recruitment). Interviews usually start with at least three rounds, and some large companies like Alibaba and ByteDance may have five rounds of interviews. **If you fail an interview, don't worry; if you perform poorly in one round, it's also okay. Adjust your mindset. It's not a single choice, right? You can apply to so many companies! Adjust your mindset.** This year, due to the pandemic, some companies may still conduct interviews online. Additionally, due to the pandemic's impact, it
