Many friends feel nervous or even scared during their first technical interview, and afterward, they often feel a bit "dazed." I have experienced similar situations, and I can relate. In fact, **feeling nervous is very normal**—it shows that you care about the interview and stems from worries about uncertain outcomes. However, if you become overly nervous, it can negatively impact your performance on the spot.

Here, I will share some of my insights to help everyone better cope with nervous emotions during interviews.

## Try to Accept Nervous Feelings and Adjust Your Mindset

First, it’s important to understand that feeling nervous is a normal emotion, especially during your first or few interviews. It’s natural to feel a bit anxious. Don’t overly reject this emotion; you can appropriately "embrace" it:

- **Understand the essence of the interview**: Essentially, an interview is an in-depth conversation with the interviewer and a two-way selection process. Failing an interview does not mean your value and efforts are denied; it may just be that you are not temporarily aligned with the desired position, or it could simply be a KPI interview where the company might not have an actual recruitment need. The reason for failure might also be that certain knowledge points, project experiences, or expressive methods did not adequately showcase your abilities. Even if this interview doesn’t go well, it doesn’t prevent you from applying to other companies—don’t panic at all!
- **Don’t be afraid of the interviewer**: Many job seekers communicate well with classmates and friends, but they feel apprehensive during the interview. The relationship between the interviewer and the job seeker is equal, and they may even become colleagues in the future. Also, don’t think that the interviewer is exceptionally skilled; in reality, their levels can vary widely. They may not fully comprehend the questions they are asking.
- **Give yourself positive psychological hints**: Tell yourself, "It's okay to be a bit nervous; this will only help me focus more. My quickened heartbeat is just my way of motivating myself, and I am definitely going to answer well!".

## Prepare in Advance to Reduce Uncertainty

**The more uncertainty there is, the easier it is to feel nervous.** If you can prepare thoroughly before the interview, many "unknowns" will disappear, and your nervousness will naturally diminish.

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

- **Prioritize core knowledge points**: For example, fundamentals of computing, databases, Java basics, Java collections, concurrent programming, SpringBoot (using Java backend as an example). If time is limited, prioritize your review based on importance. I highly recommend reading the article [Key Points of Java Interviews (Important)](https://javaguide.cn/interview-preparation/key-points-of-interview.html).
- **Carefully prepare your project experience**: Think deeply about the most important projects on your resume (focus on the two most recent projects before the interview, especially the first one), including their technical challenges, business logic, architecture designs, and potential points the interviewer may delve into. Summarize your thinking into possible interview questions and try to answer them.

### Simulate Interviews and Self-Test

- **Ask friends or classmates to interview each other**: Perform exercises in a real interview setting and diagnose and provide feedback on your answers promptly.
- **Online practice**: Many platforms offer AI simulation interviews that can realistically simulate the questioning scenario of an interviewer.
- **Interview experiences**: Frequently read interview experiences compiled by predecessors, especially for your target position or company, summarizing high-frequency examination points and common questions.
- **Self-test on technical interview questions**: In the [“Java Interview Guide”](https://javaguide.cn/zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.html) under the "Technical Interview Questions Self-Test" section, I summarized the most commonly asked interview questions related to the most important knowledge points in Java interviews and presented them in interview questioning format. Each question includes hints and importance levels, making it very suitable for self-testing.

### Express Yourself More

Make it a habit to talk more and express your thoughts, rather than just thinking about them. Otherwise, you may find that what you think and what you say are different during the actual interview.

The simulations and self-tests I recommended earlier are partly aimed at helping you express yourself more.

### Attend More Interviews

- **Start with smaller companies and then move to larger ones**: You can first try companies that are smaller or less stressful for you to gain practical experience and build confidence. After becoming familiar with the interview process and feeling more at ease answering questions, you can challenge yourself with your desired larger companies or popular firms.
- **Gather "failure experiences"**: Don’t fear rejection; sometimes, being turned down can teach you a lot more. Reflect and analyze what went wrong in which stage, and then approach the next interview with an improved mindset.

### Ensure Rest

- **Allow enough time**: Try not to schedule too many things before the interview to ensure you are in a good state for the interview.
- **Ensure adequate rest**: Sufficient sleep helps stabilize emotions and allows you to think more clearly during the interview.

## Don’t Panic When Encountering Unknown Questions

In an interview, it’s unlikely that you can handle every question posed by the interviewer with ease, unless the interview is very simple.

During the interview process, if you encounter a question you don't know, the first thing to do is quickly review your past knowledge to see if you can find a breakthrough. If you truly have no idea, don’t hesitate to ask the interviewer for some hints, such as discussing your understanding of the question and what confuses you. Do not feel embarrassed to ask for hints; as long as communication is smooth, it’s quite normal. The worst thing is to not know the answer and respond randomly, which can make the interviewer feel you have a problem with your technical attitude.

## Review After the Interview

Many people focus on preparation before the interview but overlook the importance of reviewing afterward; this step is truly very, very, very important:

1. **Record the questions during the interview**: Regardless of how well you answered, write them down. If you were asked questions you hadn’t considered, think carefully about them and supplement your answers after the interview.
1. **Reflect on your performance**: Did you encounter any blocks? Was it due to insufficient knowledge preparation or was it too much nervousness that led to confused expression? How can you improve next time?
1. **Continuously improve your "interview question bank"**: Add new questions, progressively expand your knowledge base, and gradually reduce your fear of unknown questions.
