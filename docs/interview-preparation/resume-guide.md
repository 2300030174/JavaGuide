::: tip Friendly Reminder
This article is excerpted from **[“Java Interview Guide”](../zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.md)**. It is a booklet that teaches you how to prepare for interviews more efficiently, covering common topics (system design, common frameworks, distributed systems, high concurrency, etc.), and high-quality interview experiences.

## Introduction

A good resume plays a very important role throughout the application and interview process.

**Why is the resume so important?** We can discuss it from the following points:

**1. The resume is like our facade; it largely determines whether we can get an interview opportunity.**

- If you are applying online, your resume will inevitably go through HR's screening. An HR person might spend only about 10 seconds looking at a resume before deciding whether you can proceed to the interview.
- If you are referred internally, if your resume does not have any advantages, even if the person referring you is very diligent, it will be of no help.

Moreover, even if you pass the first round of screening and get an interview opportunity, the interviewer will also judge whether you are worth their time based on your resume.

**2. The content on the resume largely determines the focus of the interviewer's questions.**

- Generally, the things you list on your resume are what will be asked about (Java basics, collections, concurrency, MySQL, Redis, Spring, Spring Boot are all must-ask topics). For example, if you state that you are proficient in Redis, the interviewer is likely to ask you some questions about Redis. Similarly, if you mention that you used message queues in your projects, the interviewer will likely ask many questions related to message queues.
- The level of proficiency in skills also largely determines the depth of the interviewer's questions.

Writing a good resume without exaggerating your abilities is also a great skill. Generally, those with strong technical and learning abilities tend to write better resumes!

## Resume Template

The style of the resume is extremely important!!! If your resume is unattractive, the interviewer will really have no desire to continue reading. You wouldn't understand the pain of processing hundreds of resumes in a day!

I recommend everyone use Markdown syntax to write their resumes and then convert the Markdown format to PDF for submission. If you are not familiar with Markdown syntax, you can spend half an hour to briefly look at the Markdown syntax guide: <http://www.markdown.cn/>.

Here are some decent resume templates I have collected:

- Collection of resume templates suitable for Chinese (recommended, open source and free): <https://github.com/dyweb/awesome-resume-for-chinese>
- Mujicv (recommended, partially free): <https://www.mujicv.com/>
- Easy Resume (recommended, partially free): <https://easycv.cn/>
- Minimalist Resume (free): <https://www.polebrief.com/index>
- Markdown Resume Formatting Tool (open source and free): <https://resume.mdnice.com/>
- Webmaster Resume (paid, supports AI generation): <https://jianli.chinaz.com/>
- Typora + Markdown + CSS custom resume template: <https://github.com/Snailclimb/typora-markdown-resume>
- Super Resume (partially paid): <https://www.wondercv.com/>

Most of these resume templates are only one page long, making it difficult to showcase enough information. If you are not a top-tier talent (like an ACM competition winner), I suggest writing a bit more to highlight your abilities (within 2 pages for campus recruits, within 3 pages for social recruits, remember to refine your language and avoid excessive fluff).

Here are a few **layout tips for resumes**:

- Keep it simple; avoid overly flashy designs.
- It's best to standardize the capitalization of technical terms, for example, java -> Java, spring boot -> Spring Boot. While some interviewers may not mind, many will pay attention to these details.
- Adding spaces between Chinese characters and English numbers makes it look more comfortable.

Additionally, there are real resume templates available for reference in the Knowledge Planet, address: <https://t.zsxq.com/12ypxGNzU> (you need to join [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) to access).

## Resume Content

### Personal Information

- The basics: Name (the one on your ID), age, phone number, place of origin, contact information, email address.
- Potential bonus items: GitHub address, blog address (if your technical blog and GitHub have no content, don’t include them).
