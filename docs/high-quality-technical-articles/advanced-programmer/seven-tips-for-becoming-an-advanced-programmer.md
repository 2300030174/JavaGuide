### Suggestion 1: Deliberately Strengthen Requirement Review Skills

Let's start with requirement reviews. In internet companies, requirement reviews are the main entry point for development work.

For ordinary programmers, it usually means imagining how to implement a feature based on the details provided by the product manager, estimating how long the development will take. They see themselves as translators between requirements and code, rarely considering the rationality of the requirements or the value of what they are doing.

In contrast, senior programmers do not get bogged down in details from the start; instead, they focus more on the product itself, asking the product manager why this detail is necessary and what its purpose is. In other words, they first consider whether the requirement is reasonable.

If the requirement is unreasonable, they will engage in a discussion, either adjusting the requirement or discarding it. However, it's important to note that this discussion and adjustment can also mean enhancing the requirement rather than just cutting it.

Product colleagues, lacking a technical background, may not think things through sufficiently. If you have a better idea, you can propose it to be included in the requirement, making it more valuable.

In summary, senior programmers do not simply follow the product manager's requirement document for subsequent development; instead, they **think from the perspective of what benefits the business, modifying, deleting, or adding to the product manager's requirements.**

This work may seem unrelated to development on the surface, but it is the only way to ensure that all subsequent developers are creating value rather than doing a lot of useless work. Excessive useless work can greatly diminish a developer's sense of achievement.

Therefore, **if ordinary programmers want to grow into more senior developers, they must strengthen their requirement review skills.**

### Suggestion 2: Proactively Think About Efficiency

Ordinary programmers tend to write code in a step-by-step manner, doing tasks as they come and idling when there is no work. They rarely deeply consider why the existing code is written this way, what the benefits are, where the bottlenecks exist, and whether they can optimize it.

In contrast, more advanced programmers do not limit themselves to just completing the tasks at hand. They actively ponder whether the current development model is sufficient. They think about what they can create to improve efficiency.

For example, when I took over a project six years ago, I found that the operations team would come to me four times a month just to ask me to send a push notification. They said previous developers had helped them this way. Although this request was simple—just changing a couple of lines and releasing it—it was annoying. Imagine being focused on writing code and then being interrupted repeatedly. Moreover, frequently operating online introduces uncertain risks; if a mistake happens, it could lead to significant issues.

My solution was to dedicate a week to create an operations backend for them. This way, they could handle all push notifications directly through the backend, allowing me to focus on more valuable tasks.

Thus, **the second suggestion is to proactively think about where there is room for improvement in your current work efficiency and take the initiative to improve it!**

### Suggestion 3: Enhance Internal Capabilities

What constitutes internal capabilities? Readers familiar with internal skills training will know that it refers to the fundamentals we all learned in school, such as operating systems and networks.

Ordinary programmers might think, "I know these foundational concepts; I studied them for four years in college." However, after starting work, they often do not intentionally revisit and deepen their understanding of these fundamentals.

Senior programmers are acutely aware that the knowledge they learned back then was superficial. In their spare time, they delve into the underlying implementations of Linux, networking, and other areas.

In fact, many technical experts in the internet industry have a profound understanding of these fundamentals, which has contributed to their growth as technical leaders.

I find it hard to believe that someone who does not understand the underlying principles and only knows how to perform CRUD operations or use others' frameworks can grow into a technical expert.

Therefore, **I suggest you work on enhancing your foundational technical skills**. If you don't know how to practice
