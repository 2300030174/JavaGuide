The sea of bitterness is boundless; turning back is no shore.

## 01 Introduction

After five years in the internet industry, I find myself reflecting on my journey. Where does it feel like a place of dim lights?

When entering the workforce, most programmers believe that by diligently learning technology, they will smoothly advance in their careers and receive salary increases. This thought is not wrong, but it is not comprehensive. The core question five years later is whether you will continue to work in technology and write code.

At the beginning of your career, you might think that working hard and putting in overtime can continuously enhance your abilities. You might accept a lower salary if the company offers good learning opportunities. However, after five years, you may feel that overtime is merely squeezing your upward mobility, and a low salary becomes a ceiling in life.

The key issue here is that the perceptions and thoughts of newcomers to the workforce will largely not apply to the understanding five years later.

The greatest pressure faced after five years of work is the choice: the career ceiling, the technical ability ceiling, the salary ceiling, and the thirty-year-old ceiling.

How to face these issues is something most programmers are contemplating and struggling with. The only reference point for making choices is: maximizing benefits, which can be understood as better promotions and salary increases in the workplace.

In five years, the most significant change is not work experience or skill accumulation, but mindsetâ€”clearly understanding that there is a huge gap between reality and ideals.

## 02 Learn to Adapt to Change and Accumulate Skills

Looking back on my five years in the workplace, the most recognized statement is: learn to adapt to change and accumulate skills.

What has changed is that in five years, technology frameworks have been updated and iterated, development tools have evolved, company environments and teammates have changed, and even the wandering between different cities has occurred. The classic saying goes: the only constant is change itself.

What needs to be accumulated is: problem-solving abilities, ways of thinking, and broadening understanding.

This is difficult to describe directly and belongs to the realm of personal cognition. Different people have different views, so we can only think from a generalized perspective.

First, let's talk about technology. Most beginners hope to continuously improve their technical skills and strive to reach the architect level. However, in the current internet environment, the difficulty of achieving this is relatively high. This is neither to discourage nor to argue.

We can observe the current situation: large technical teams have 20-30 people, while smaller ones have 10-15. It is rare to have an architect specifically managing the underlying framework.

There are many reasons for this issue. First, the cost of an architect is too high, and the environmental architecture does not need frequent upgrades. To put it bluntly, the framework may outlast the project lifecycle.

Thus, most companies can solve the majority of their business needs based on existing mature open-source frameworks. This leads to the role of architect often being replaced by project leads or higher-level developers, which is the reality.

This results in the thought process for selecting technology frameworks being: only choose what is right. That is, there are many talents in this area, and many open-source solutions, which reduces the impact of technology on the company's business development.

So why continue to learn and accumulate technical skills? Without this ability, a programmer may not last five years in the role. It is necessary to deeply accumulate technical knowledge to continuously solve various problems at work and to broaden one's understanding of business needs through the breadth of technology. This is the fundamental guarantee for placing one's body and soul in a stable position.

This is why many programmers experience a sudden increase in pressure after five years, and another barrier to moving into management roles is the need for business thinking and understanding.

## 03 Accumulating Business Skills

Should programmers diligently study business? This question really does not require much debate. As long as it is not a purely technical company, everyone needs to face business.

Whether in technology, operations, product management, or management, all are working towards business objectives.

From my career trajectory, the most significant change over five years has been the ability to solve business problems. At the beginning of my career, I often did not know how to approach many business scenarios, but after a few years, I was able to design solutions for business challenges.

This is the fundamental reason why most programmers can see salary increases when changing jobs within
