Recently, several young colleagues have talked to me about their confusion. Some discussions were about technical growth, some about promotions, and some about career choices. I am glad they are willing to listen to the experiences of someone who has been through it.

After graduating, I entered a large company and worked there for 12 years. The content I share comes from my own experiences or those of people around me. In particular, I will combine **[the detours I have taken]** and **[the qualities of excellent technical individuals I have observed]** to provide advice.

I believe these insights have universal guiding significance, so I decided to organize and share them. I believe that whether you are in a large or small company, if you believe in this advice, it will help you sooner or later.

Having worked for 12 years and taken some detours myself, I want to discuss "what to pay attention to in the development of a technical person over ten years." We will divide the content into two parts:

1. **How to Navigate the Technical Path Over Ten Years**
1. **Some Important Choices**

## 01 How to Navigate the Technical Path Over Ten Years

### [1-2 Years] => From "Novice" to "Professional"

When fresh graduates first enter the workforce, they often face various adjustments. For example, well-written code may be repeatedly rejected, discussions with experienced team members may leave them with many questions, they may hesitate to ask questions or challenge ideas, and they may struggle alone when encountering problems.

**In simple terms, even if you work day and night, you may still find it difficult to carry out your work smoothly.**

The most important points during this stage are:

**[Observe and Imitate]**: For instance, when writing code, don’t just focus on whether the functionality is correct like you did in school; also pay attention to module design, exception handling, code readability, etc. Even before you fully understand these concepts, start imitating what you see, and gradually you will understand how real-world code is written and why it is written that way.

The same applies when creating technical solutions; you may not fully understand the requirements of technical documentation, but you can start by referencing existing documents.

**[Be a Little Thick-Skinned]**: Don’t hesitate to ask questions; everyone understands you are a newcomer. You can also seek reviews from experienced colleagues for your various proposals; don’t be afraid of being laughed at.

**[Focus on Work Methods]**: For example, if you find that a requirement cannot be completed within the planned time, report the risk as soon as possible, and ensure timely reporting of work content (such as weekly reports), confirm meeting conclusions and to-do items after meetings, and strive to meet deadlines while strictly adhering to company requirements (such as release specifications, permission specifications, etc.).

Generally speaking, after working for two years, you should become a professional. Your boss should be able to trust you with any task without unexpected issues (for example, being told that an important requirement cannot go live tomorrow).

### [3-4 Years] => From "Professional" to "Elite"

After two years of work, your understanding of the business and existing systems reaches a certain level, and technical colleagues will begin to take on more challenging technical tasks.

For example, you may need to improve performance to a certain level, refactor an important module, or collaborate with multiple teams to complete a significant project.

Clearly, these technical issues are far more complex than ordinary requirements. Solving these problems requires a certain level of technical ability, as well as higher collaboration skills.

The most important points during this stage are:

**[Enhance Technical Skills]**: Actively learn from both internal and external technical content. Most technical challenges at this stage focus on [performance], [stability], and [scalability], and there are established methodologies in the industry for these areas.

**[Sense of Ownership]**: Technical challenges involve not only the design and implementation of technical solutions but also a series of other tasks. For example, observing the effects after going live, understanding the degree of transformation and risks for key projects, and planning for subsequent technical improvements (such as phase two and phase three optimization ideas).

After four years of work, you will generally become one of the top technical positions in the team. Many technical challenges may not be implemented by you, but you will be responsible for deciding
