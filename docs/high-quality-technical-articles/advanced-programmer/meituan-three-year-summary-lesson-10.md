My time at Meituan, spanning over three years, feels like a long symphony with its highs and lows, and it has been a while since I left. In my spare time, I have organized my gains and reflections from these years into ten points, which serve as both a heartfelt look back at the past and a hopeful outlook for the future.

If some insights can provide a bit of inspiration and help to young people just entering the workforce or to rising stars in their careers, it would be a great honor.

## 01 Structured Thinking and Expression

Meituan is a company that places great emphasis on methodology; everyone is expected to be well-versed in the four classics: "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," "The Pyramid Principle," "Talk Like TED," and "A More Beautiful Question."

Related to structured thinking and expression is "The Pyramid Principle," authored by the first female consultant at McKinsey. This book teaches us that the process of thinking and expression is like building a pyramid (or a tree); you start with an overall conclusion, then seek evidence, ensuring that the evidence is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE principle), and the argumentation process should follow a specific order, such as chronological, spatial, or by importance...

As a corporate worker, a significant part of daily work involves writing documents and reviewing others' documents. While everyone does similar tasks, the final results can vary greatly. A logically clear and appropriately detailed document provides a refreshing experience, distilling important information and serving as a good reference guide.

Structured thinking and expression are among the most universal skills in the workplace and are one of the most important ways to build personal influence.

## 02 Forget About Job Titles; Confront Issues Head-On

When I worked at Alibaba, I could see everyone’s titles and would naturally feel a layer of respect for those with higher status (higher title + longer tenure), even if they were not in my reporting line. This added pressure when pushing work forward, especially when the other party had read but not responded.

At Meituan, you can only see each person's position and their superior. You can ask anyone about work-related issues, and if the collaborator does not respond promptly, it’s perfectly fine to @ them again after a while or even "confront" them; what matters most is pushing things forward. Besides directly asking in the group chat, there’s a powerful tool—TT (the company-wide issue circulation system). When you ask a question there and tag the other party's supervisor, if they do not respond in time, the issue will automatically escalate and be pushed daily until resolved.

I’ve seen some very young colleagues who are quite adept at pushing OKRs and requesting resources; as long as they can achieve their goals, they don’t consider others' feelings, and they often get things done.

Of course, those at higher levels can use their charisma, influence, and resources to affect and drive the process rather than relying solely on pushing others. However, when it comes to achieving results, don’t take yourself too seriously or others too seriously; everyone is just here to complete their tasks. Forget about job titles and confront issues when necessary.

## 03 Make Good Use of Platform Resources

No one can stay at a company for a lifetime; no matter how great the company is, it’s not
