When interviewing or pursuing side jobs, being able to convincingly demonstrate your abilities can lead to significant advantages. How can you prove your capabilities? The most convincing endorsement comes from having a background in a major company, such as being a senior architect at BAT; in that case, you might not need to say much more.

However, not everyone becomes a major company architect immediately after starting a job. On the path to advancement, you can prove yourself through public accounts, column articles, GitHub contributions, and publishing books or videos. Compared to other methods, having your own technical book, backed by a national-level publisher, can significantly enhance others' recognition of your abilities. For some smaller companies, having your own book can even serve as a pass that allows you to skip interviews. Therefore, in this article, I will discuss the various aspects of publishing a technical book with fellow programmers.

## 1. It's not about having the ability to publish a book, but about improving your skills during the writing process

I know several friends who published their first book within three years of working, and some outstanding individuals even published books while still in school.

In contrast, there is another attitude where many students might think they should wait until they have accumulated enough technical knowledge before writing. This mindset may not be very proactive. You can write a book while improving your skills, and the book you produce can help others; this is absolutely achievable.

For example, if someone wants to delve into the currently popular topics of Python data analysis and machine learning, they can systematically study these subjects, organize their previous learning on web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning cases, and then compile their understanding in a way that is suitable for beginners. This way, they can publish a book. Such a book may not be very helpful for advanced readers, but it will definitely assist entry-level readers because it provides real-world examples. Moreover, if there is no motivation to publish a book, the learning process may be superficial, and one might not fully engage. Having the goal of publishing a book can ensure better learning outcomes.

## 2. Books Suitable for Junior Developers, Senior Developers, and Architects

As mentioned earlier, junior developers are suitable for writing case study books. Taking Python web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning as an example, one can start by finding a few existing books on these topics. While the content or chapters may differ, integrating them can cover the necessary material. Then, you can follow the structure of others' books, such as dedicating one chapter to web scraping, another to pandas, and another to matplotlib, and so on, to create a book composed of several chapters. In summary, while you shouldn't copy the content of others' books, you can reference the technical points they cover.

Once the chapters are determined, you can outline the subsections for each chapter. For instance, if Chapter 3 discusses web scraping cases, you might define 3.1 as the concept of web scraping, 3.2 as how to set up the Scrapy library, and 3.3 as how to develop a Scrapy web scraping case. By establishing a chapter and subsection order, you can create a framework for the book. Since this is a case study book, you should first provide runnable code and then use these code examples to teach others the basics. The cases may not be very deep, but they need to be understandable for beginners, allowing them to learn progressively according to the knowledge system you provide. After reading your book, they should be able to run the web scraping and machine learning examples you provide, mastering the knowledge in this field and being able to engage in basic development. This goal should be achievable for junior developers with a bit of effort and time.

For senior developers and architects, in addition to writing pure case study books, you can also share the development experiences you have summarized from working in large companies, such as the pitfalls you have encountered. For example, when using matplotlib in Python, what tips are there for setting axes, and what common problems might arise? Including such experiences in your book will increase its value.

Additionally, senior developers and architects can write books with higher technical content, such as sharing practical experiences in high-concurrency scenarios or discussing k8s and Docker for handling high concurrency. In such books, you can provide code, implementation plans, and architectural implementation techniques, such as how to choose caching strategies in high-concurrency scenarios, how to avoid issues like cache breakdown and avalanche, how to troubleshoot online Redis problems, and how to design contingency plans. Beyond this, you can delve into details, such as explaining how to efficiently configure Dubbo through its underlying code
