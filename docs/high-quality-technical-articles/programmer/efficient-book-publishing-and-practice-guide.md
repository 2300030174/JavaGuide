In ancient times, there were three pillars of immortality: establishing virtue, achieving merit, and making noteworthy statements. For a programmer to publish a book of their own may seem overly grand to call it "making noteworthy statements," yet it is undoubtedly an elegant endeavor.

Publishing a book does not actually bring in much money, and the timeline from writing to receiving payment is also lengthy. However, for a programmer to have their own technical book can certainly serve as a strong proof of their skills during interviews and gradually build their reputation within the industry, providing significant confidence in interviews and other endeavors. In this article, I will share my experiences and the pitfalls I have encountered while discussing matters related to programmers publishing books.

## 1. Royalties and Required Time for Publishing

Let’s start with the earnings from publishing and the investments required; here, I will not discuss the "intangible assets" brought by publishing, but rather the tangible royalties.

If you contact a publisher directly, royalties are usually calculated as a percentage of the book price—typically 8% multiplied by the printed quantity (or actual sales quantity). If you are a well-known figure in the field, you might negotiate a higher percentage, but generally, royalties are estimated at around 10% to 12%. Please note that this percentage is based on the full price of the book, not the discounted price.

For example, if the full price of a book is 70 yuan, and it is sold at a 30% discount on platforms like JD.com, the royalty from each sale would be calculated as 8% of 70 yuan. In other words, the author would earn 5.6 yuan from the sale of each book, but taxes will still need to be deducted upon payment.

Moreover, please note that the contract stipulates whether the payment of royalties is based on printed quantities or actual sales numbers. In my discussions with publishers, it typically pertains to the printed quantity. What’s the difference? Nowadays, the first print run for computer-related books is usually around 2,500 copies, meaning the pre-tax earnings would be calculated as 70\*8%\*2500. Of course, taxes would also apply. However, if royalties are based on actual sales and the first print run sells only 1,800 copies, the calculation will be adjusted accordingly.

Currently, a typical 300-page book is priced at around 70 yuan. Assuming an 8% royalty and a print run of 2,500 copies, the pre-tax earnings would be approximately 14,000 yuan, leading to an estimated post-tax income of around 12,000 yuan. For a novice author, writing a 300-page book usually requires at least 8 months, allowing you to calculate an average monthly income, which amounts to only about 1,500 yuan—a rather modest figure.

While I cannot speak for others, I can share that aside from royalties, there are several other benefits I gained from publishing my book:

- During interviews with my current and previous companies, when I informed the interviewer that I had published a book on relevant topics, they immediately regarded me as very seasoned, which saved me a lot of effort.
- I am also conducting offline training sessions and have used my recently published Python book as teaching material, which saved me preparation time.
- When discussing projects with others, my book serves as proof of my technical capabilities. If it’s my first time interacting with someone, having this proof is quite effective.

Especially the first point holds true; for some small companies or remote positions, if a candidate has published a book in this domain, they may even be offered direct employment without an interview. I once interviewed for a remote position with a large company and experienced such treatment.

## 2. Timing of Royalty Payments and Income from Reprints

I contacted the publisher directly to publish my book, and the timing of royalty payments generally involves receiving a portion of the royalties (typically 50% to 90%) within three months after the first print run, with the remaining royalties paid out a year after publication. Nowadays, many books are fortunate if they sell out their first print run, but some do get reprints and even second and third editions. Generally, the royalties from reprints are settled within six months to a year.

Considering the timing of royalty payments, authors often face delays, and coupled with the relatively low royalties compared to the author’s labor, publishing really isn’t a profitable venture, especially since the waiting period for payment is long. If individual staff at publishing companies provide little support during the publication process and also attempt to profit off the author’s hard work, it indeed undermines the efforts of authors.

## 3. Experiences with Various Publishing Companies

Before communicating with the editors at publishing houses, I also interacted with staff from publishing companies. Many of them were respectful towards me during our exchanges; while the conversations weren’t particularly deep, they were courteous. However, after comparing the royalties and conditions offered by the publishers, I ultimately did not go through a publishing company to publish my book, which I consider somewhat unfortunate. Below are some specific experiences I had.

- I frequently receive messages from staff at publishing companies on platforms like CSDN, inquiring if I want to publish a book. Typically, unless I ask, they do not specify whether they are publishers' editors or publishing company staff. Some staff may tell authors, especially novice authors, that "publishers’ editors generally do not contact authors directly" and "books are usually published through publishing companies." While there is some truth to this, if authors directly contact publishers’ editors, it’s neither difficult nor is there any barrier.
- When discussing outlines with publishers’ editors, even if there are shortcomings in the outline, they can provide specific suggestions for modifications, such as what to write in a particular chapter or how to organize a section’s outline. However, in discussions with some staff at publishing companies regarding outlines, the feedback tends to be "needs to be rewritten," but how to rewrite it? These staff members often provide only abstract advice, leaving it for me to figure things out independently. In my previous blog post [How Do Programmers Publish Technical Books](./how-do-programmers-publish-a-technical-book), I had detailed experiences on this.
- Due to the lack of deep communication, I have never signed a publishing agreement with a publishing company, but I know that only publishers can publish books. Since I have no personal experience in this area, I cannot confirm whether publishing companies include clauses for risk avoidance in their contracts. Nonetheless, I have seen cases of rejected manuscripts presented by some publishing company staff, which subtly implied a blame towards the authors. Upon reflection, this seems inappropriate. The connecting staff should first be able to identify issues promptly and provide feedback to the authors. Secondly, they should coordinate effectively in the event of problems to prevent rejection. Lastly, once a manuscript is rejected, the publishing company does not bear any risk despite the author’s effort but ends up criticizing the author. Sure, rejections can stem from the author's actions, but as a fellow author, I find it hard not to sympathize. In contrast, when I published with a traditional publisher, the editors sometimes reached out proactively to help me, providing materials, and even addressing issues quickly, so large-scale revisions were very rare.
- Regarding royalties from publishing companies, I have seen offers that pay per page, for instance, 30 to 50 yuan per page, with a buyout of rights, meaning that once the book is reprinted, the author does not receive additional royalties. As for royalties offered based on percentages, I have seen offers around 6%. However, I have not seen publishing companies providing 8% or higher, so I cannot speculate further.

I have communicated with relatively few staff from publishing companies, and those conversations were not particularly deep, as my main focus has been on discussions with editors from traditional publishers. Therefore, the above points are just my impressions based on interactions with certain publishing company staff, and I do not intend to generalize. At least those publishing company staff I dealt with were respectful in their approach. It’s worth experimenting between collaborating with publishing companies and traditional publishers. Regardless, before writing or signing a publishing agreement, you need to clarify the following matters, and the other party has an obligation to inform you of the following facts.

- You need to clarify whether the other party is a publisher’s editor or publishing company staff, and this should ideally be mentioned proactively.
- Which publisher is your book going to be published by? This should be clearly stated in the publishing agreement and cannot be determined after the manuscript is completed. Ultimately, it is the publisher that can publish the book, not the publishing company.
- The method of royalty payments; even if the publishing company may profit off the difference, you should at least understand the royalties offered by the publisher. If you are publishing through a publishing company, regardless of how they negotiate with you, the publisher will not pay them any less. The difference is where the publishing company profits should lie.
- Finally, you must clarify before signing the agreement whether it is the publishing company or the publisher that you are signing with. Even if you eventually sign with the publishing company, you should at least be aware that you can sign directly with the publisher.
- You should not assume that "publishing with a publishing company requires lower standards," nor should you think "my abilities are average, so I can only publish with a publishing company." Publishing companies are not qualified to publish books themselves, meaning they will also submit manuscripts to publishers, thus their conditions should not be lower. If your outline is not accepted by the publisher's editor, it will similarly not be accepted by the publishing company's staff, regardless of whether your requested royalty is lower. The corresponding requirements from the publishing company will certainly not diminish.

If you are aware of the differences between "publishing companies and publishers," yet choose to collaborate with a publishing company, this is a mutually agreed decision. However, if the other party does not proactively provide this information and you engage with a publishing company without understanding the differences, then they cannot be blamed. That said, it’s wise to seek multiple opinions; if you are looking to publish a book, try to interact with both publishers and publishing companies for comparison.

## 4. How to Directly Contact Renowned Domestic Computer Book Publishers' Editors

I have published books with Tsinghua University Press, Mechanical Industry Press, Peking University Press, and Electronics Industry Press. The publishing process has been relatively smooth, and my interactions with the editors have been quite pleasant. I have no intention of categorizing domestic publishers into hierarchies, but some well-known publishers in the computer science field include Tsinghua, MEUP, Electronics Industry, and People’s Postal. Of course, other publishers have also released excellent books in the computer domain.

How can one directly communicate with editors from these well-known publishers?

- Visit their official websites, as they usually provide direct contact information.
- If you publish articles on CSDN or similar platforms, someone may reach out to you for book publishing. Aside from publishing company staff, there may also be publisher’s editors, who typically identify themselves directly (e.g., "I am xx from xx publisher").
- I have also contacted some editors from various publishers, so if anyone needs, I can provide those contacts.

So how can you find staff from publishing companies? Generally, there is no need to actively seek them out; after publishing several articles, they will reach out to you. If you inquire, "Are you a publisher's editor or a publishing company's editor?" they will clarify their identity. If you press further, they may explain the differences between publishers and publishing companies from the publishing company’s perspective.

From this, it is clear that whether or not you end up writing a book, it is not difficult to seek out editors from well-known publishers. Moreover, once you establish contact, they will further discuss the selections with you.

## 5. Determining Topics and the Publishing Process

Here I outline the process of discussing collaboration with a publisher's editor, ultimately leading to publication:

First, after making contact with the publisher's editor, discuss the topic. You can choose a direction you are familiar with or one you wish to specialize in—aspects may include Java distributed components, the Spring Cloud suite, microservices, or Python data analysis, machine learning, or deep learning. Having solid project experience in this area is preferable; however, if you are not familiar at the time but possess the determination to engage in systematic learning to ensure that your content is coherent and beneficial to others, you can still publish in these areas.

Second, once you have determined your topic, create an outline. Taking Python data analysis as an example, you might draft 12 chapters: the first chapter on syntax, the second on NumPy, and so forth. When formulating your outline, you can refer to the contents of others' books to help organize your writing. After establishing your outline, you can discuss it with the editor. If the editor also approves of the outline, you can proceed to draft a publishing agreement.

For most authors, the publishing agreements tend to be similar, generally offering royalties around 8%. The writing period is usually negotiated with the publisher, and the payment timeline may also vary, with publishers typically purchasing the electronic and textual rights to the book. However, if the author is an esteemed figure, these details can usually be negotiated with the publisher.

Next comes the writing process, which can be quite tedious, especially when nearing the final chapters. I typically write for half an hour each workday, with four to five hours dedicated on weekends, allowing me to complete a 300-page book in about six months. Tips for efficient writing will be discussed later on.

While writing, it is advisable to submit each chapter for editorial review as it is completed, which helps mitigate significant issues. As a novice author, refining your terminology and writing techniques is paramount and can be supported by editors from the publisher during the initial stages.

After submitting the manuscript to the editor, there may be a process of revisions and reviews. The cooperating editor typically assists in correcting grammar and typos and would then provide me with a feedback document to review and revise. From what I understand, in the context of publishing companies, the risk of manuscript rejection often occurs at this stage since the publishing company may opt to send the entire manuscript in one go. However, because I directly submit each chapter to the publisher's editor for review, any major issues are often identified and corrected early on, leading to a shorter list of revision notes at the end. This means that if communication is maintained directly with the publisher, the workload during the review stage may not be overly burdensome. Usually, after I submit a complete manuscript, the editor handles the revisions while I continue to plan and begin writing my next book.

The last step is receiving royalties. As mentioned earlier, authors should not expect too much from royalties; they may simply be meager. Nonetheless, if you inadvertently write a bestseller that sells between 5,000 and 10,000 copies, you could potentially gain an additional income of around 50,000 yuan within a year and gradually build your reputation in the industry.

## 6. Case Books Are Quicker to Write than Experience Books

For some authors, especially novices, writing a book can be challenging, often leading to initial enthusiasm for the first few chapters, only to find that the issues pile up, and with work commitments, the book is left unfinished, or it may take over a year to complete. In my experience, the longest writing period for a 300 to 400-page book is 8 months. To accomplish this, I suggest that novice authors start by writing case books instead of introductory experience books.

What constitutes a case book? For instance, a book might traverse a significant case that systematically introduces a knowledge point, such as mini-program development or full-stack development. Alternatively, each chapter could feature a case, with a total of about 10 cases focusing on Python deep learning. As for experience-oriented books, these include titles discussing interview experiences or writings by tech experts illustrating their experiences in distributed high-concurrency development.

Please note that I am not distinguishing between the two types of books; it simply tends to be easier for novice authors to write case books. This is primarily because they rely on visual explanations; first presenting a case (like an image recognition case in Python deep learning), then explaining the API usage (how to use the corresponding Python library), along with an overview of the key points of the technology. Furthermore, case books require less subjective interpretation on the author's part, allowing them to avoid rephrasing established experiences. For novice authors, while organizing text to convey their experiences, they may have clear understanding but face difficulties articulating effectively, which can hinder progress.

In contrast, case books usually derive their cases from existing samples. Moreover, explaining established technologies is often easier than presenting personal experiences. Thirdly, there are similar books available for reference, decreasing the need for authors to be overly meticulous about wording. Therefore, it is indeed possible for novice authors to complete a book within six to eight months. After accumulating experience through writing a few books, they may then challenge themselves with experience-based works, which could lead to potential bestsellers.

So, to efficiently publish a case book, here are some specific tips:

- For the entire book, start with a small number of chapters introducing the environment setup and basic syntax.
- While writing each chapter with case studies, use a structure of introduction, body, and conclusion. First, broadly introduce the functionalities and technologies involved in the case, then break down the code implementation for each functionality, and finally summarize the key takeaways.
- As you walk through specific code examples in the case studies, also employ the same structure: introduce the overall design of the code first, then detail the key code snippets, and conclude by demonstrating the output while summarizing the technical highlights.

With this approach, you can aim to complete one chapter in a month at the beginning, and later, as you become more proficient, you could aim for two chapters a month. Completing a book within eight months becomes quite feasible.

## 7. How to Reference Existing Content While Avoiding Copyright Issues

When writing a book, it is often necessary to reference existing code and books, but this should not be repetitive labor. For instance, if an author aggregates multiple cases from different websites and systematically presents Python data analysis, even if the resources are readily available, it provides a one-stop learning experience for readers. Likewise, if existing books provide several cases in Python neural networks—like facial recognition—effectively synthesizing those along with adding your functionalities will also offer value to readers.

This raises questions of copyright. The author should have no illusions; if copyright issues arise, they could potentially damage their reputation severely. If a book has not yet been published, that’s one thing; if it is already published and problems surface, not only might the author face financial consequences, but they may also earn a negative reputation in the industry.

However, avoiding copyright issues is not particularly difficult.

- Do not plagiarize existing content from the internet, not even a single sentence. Authors should summarize while understanding the meanings of sentences written by others. Never copy another author's table of contents or sections verbatim; similarly, each sentence must be rephrased when appropriate.
- Do not plagiarize code from GitHub or anywhere else, even if it’s open-source. Instead, authors should understand the code, run it, and then create a new project to incorporate features based on the existing code while avoiding lengthy copying and pasting. Your code must be distinguishable from the original in terms of comments, variable names, class names, and method names; you can, of course, add your unique features.
- When writing technical descriptions and case studies, you should express these in your own words to avoid copyright issues.

By following these guidelines, authors can reference existing materials while infusing their unique functionalities, articulating their insights thoroughly, and thus efficiently publish their books.

## 8. Key Issues New Authors Should Avoid

Having outlined the publishing process in detail and the writing of case books with specific methods, I would like to emphasize some practical points for new authors.

- Technical books differ from literary works in that the primary goal is ensuring the clarity of skills and knowledge points. A lighthearted tone can be added afterwards. So for novice authors, it might be better to use straightforward language to explain case studies without overemphasizing creativity in wording.
- The content should be geared towards beginners. When introducing technology, start from the most basic aspects; do not dive too deep too quickly. Taking Python machine learning as an example, you can start by explaining what machine learning is and how to implement it in Python, but beginning with practical experiences might not guarantee that absolute beginners could keep up.
- New authors may feel inclined to write everything they know. This eagerness is admirable; however, they must consider readers’ capabilities and set expectations before writing. For example, when a beginner Python developer reads my book, they should at least be able to perform tasks. The expected outcome should be realistic; for instance, it would be impractical to claim, "A beginner Python developer will achieve three years of development experience after reading my book." By establishing predetermined outcomes, authors can tailor their writing material to emphasize foundational knowledge, ensuring that readers derive genuine benefits.

That being said, if a novice author directly contacts a publisher's editor about a trending topic and elaborates on the technology through case studies, they may very well write a bestseller with sales exceeding 10,000 copies.

## 9. Conclusion: Publishing with Renowned Domestic Publishers is Truly Labor-Intensive

Currently, earning through platforms like public accounts and video recordings may yield higher returns than publishing books. Nonetheless, it should be noted that running a public account or creating video content requires long-term commitment, and initial gains may not be immediate, especially if you do not consistently publish content, potentially leading to no returns at all. Therefore, publishing a book can be an excellent preparatory step. By systematically accumulating materials through writing a book and consolidating your knowledge base, you could eventually find it much easier to earn money via public accounts or videos.

From the above discussion, we see that contacting publishers and determining topics are not particularly daunting tasks. If you aim to write a case book, finishing one is likely to be well within reach, provided you reference existing content as guidance. Really, publishing a book is indeed a labor-intensive task; as long as you are persistent, achieving the goal of publishing a book is not unattainable. It ultimately depends on your willingness to persevere. Once you have your own technical book, you can confidently tell interviewers that you are an expert in that field, and you can assertively state in your videos, public accounts, or writings that you are the author of a computer science book. More importantly, much like having experience from prestigious universities or large companies, having your own technical book serves as a solid evidence of a programmer's competence. Once you effectively consolidate your knowledge through writing a book, you can confidently assert your capabilities in job searching, freelance work, and project engagement: **I can do it!**
