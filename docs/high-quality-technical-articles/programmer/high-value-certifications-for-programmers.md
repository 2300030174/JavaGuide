Certificates are a great way to effectively prove one's abilities; they symbolize your strength. In a short interview time, certificates can score you extra points. Improving yourself through certification is a high cost-performance method. However, compared to industries like finance, construction, and healthcare, the IT industry does not have as many professional qualification certificates.

Below, I've summarized some common certificates that programmers can pursue.

## Soft Examination

The National Computer Technology and Software Professional Technical Qualification (Level) Examination, abbreviated as "Soft Examination," is a highly recognized computer technology certification in China. Although some people criticize its actual value, it is very useful in specific fields and situations. For example, the Soft Examination certificate is highly recognized in state-owned enterprises and public institutions, can be used for points-based residence permits in certain cities, and is eligible for individual tax subsidies.

The Soft Examination has three levels: junior, intermediate, and senior. It is recommended to directly take the senior exam. Compared to PMP (Project Management Professional certification), the difficulty of the senior exam is higher, especially in the paper part, where most people fail. Those who pass the senior exam can often receive internal certifications at some companies, earning several hundred more each month.

## PAT

The PAT (Pangu Computer Ability Test) focuses on assessing algorithm capabilities and is organized by Zhejiang University. The test is divided into four levels: Basic, Grade B, Grade A, and Top Grade.

By passing the PAT and achieving corresponding ratings and scores set by partner companies, candidates can bypass the degree threshold, skip resume screening and written tests, and directly obtain interview opportunities. For the list of participating companies, visit the official website: <https://www.patest.cn/company>.

For students preparing for graduate studies at Zhejiang University, the PAT (Grade A) score can be used as part of the oral exam for master’s degree admissions within one year.

## PMP

PMP (Project Management Professional) certification is provided by the Project Management Institute (PMI) in the United States and is the most recognized project management professional qualification globally. The PMP certification aims to enhance the knowledge and skills of project management professionals, ensuring successful project completion.

PMP is a globally applicable qualification certification. For project management professionals, the PMP certificate is still quite valuable. Worldwide, many successful companies consider PMP certification as an entry standard for project managers.

However! The truly valuable aspect is not the PMP certificate itself but the PMBOK project management framework, which includes many real-world cases from various sectors such as business activities, industrial projects, organizational planning, and construction.

Furthermore, the PMP certificate is not a high-end certificate but rather a foundational one.

## ACP

The ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner) certification is also provided by PMI and is another important certification in the field of project management. Unlike PMP, which emphasizes traditional waterfall methodologies, ACP focuses on agile project management methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP).

## OCP

Oracle Certified Professional (OCP) is a professional certification offered by Oracle Corporation, focusing on Oracle databases and related technologies. This certification is designed to validate and certify an individual's professional knowledge and skills in using and managing Oracle databases.

The following illustration shows the different paths and corresponding certification levels for Oracle certification, which include the Core Track and Speciality Track.

## Elastic Certification

Elastic certification consists of a series of professional certifications provided by Elastic, aimed at validating individuals' skills and knowledge in using the Elastic Stack (including Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Beats, etc.).

If your core development work involves Elasticsearch, it is highly recommended to consider taking this certification, as it holds substantial value.

Currently, Elastic certification is categorized into four types: Elastic Certified Engineer, Elastic Certified Analyst, Elastic Certified Observability Engineer, and Elastic Certified SIEM Specialist.

It is especially recommended to take the **Elastic Certified Engineer** exam, which serves as the foundational certification for the Elastic Stack, assessing skills essential for installing, configuring, managing, and maintaining Elasticsearch clusters.
