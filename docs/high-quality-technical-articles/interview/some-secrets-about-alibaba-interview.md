Recently, my work has become slightly easier, so I was assigned to participate in campus recruitment interviews.

At that time, I was a bit **excited**; previously, I was the one being interviewed, and now I have become an interviewer.

Next, I will share my interview insights (talk about Alibaba's interview secrets).

## How Do I Screen Resumes?

Before the interviews, resumes need to be screened, which everyone should know.

Alibaba takes recruitment very seriously; interviewers must review and filter every candidate's resume, and if it's not suitable, they need to clearly state the reasons.

For campus recruits, the first job is very important, and there is only one chance for the campus recruitment interview. Receiving everyone's resumes means they highly recognize and appreciate Alibaba as a company.

Therefore, we look carefully at each resume; you can rest assured that we won't discard resumes without reason.

Although we approach this with a very responsible attitude, some candidates' resumes are indeed difficult to read.

I have previously written similar articles on how to write a resume, so I will link to it here for everyone to check out: [What Should a Good Resume Include](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI4MDYzNDc1Mg==&mid=2247484010&idx=1&sn=afbe90c8446f5f21631cae750431d3ee&scene=21#wechat_redirect).

The following information is very important when screening resumes, and candidates must write them carefully:

- **Project Experience**; specifics can be found in the aforementioned article.
- **High-Value Personal Awards**; such as ACM medals, computer competitions, etc.
- **Personal Skills**; this section will be reviewed, but most resumes are similar, so try to write **concise** descriptions.
- **Publications in Important Journals, Open Source Projects**; these are considered pluses.

This information is highly important, and during my resume screening, these aspects account for about 4/5 of the entire resume.

## What Aspects Do I Focus on During the Interview?

### **Clear Expression**

This is a major flaw; during interviews, some candidates struggle to clearly explain their projects, and I feel anxious for them.

There is a simple methodology for describing projects that I have summarized, and I hope it suits you:

- It's best to concisely describe your project's background so the interviewer quickly understands what the project is about (this engages their interest quickly).
- Talk about which technologies were used in the project. Be clear on the technologies you worked with since interviewers will be very interested in your technical skills.
- What problems were solved; projects are generally undertaken to solve problems, as projects shouldn't just exist for their own sake (the ability to solve problems is very important).
- What difficulties were encountered, and how were they overcome? It's normal to face difficulties in a project; overcoming them is a sign of good growth.
- What areas still require improvement? It's impossible to design a perfect execution plan; suggesting improvements shows your deep understanding of the project and thorough thinking.

The general interview lasts about 60-80 minutes, and good expression helps us understand each other better.

### **Solid Foundation Knowledge**

Campus recruitment places a strong emphasis on foundational knowledge, so the questions in this area are numerous. I typically ask questions related to your projects to see if you have merely utilized the technology or if you have deeper insights.

Different fields have different requirements for foundational knowledge, but some basics are applicable across the board.

For instance, **Data Structures and Algorithms**, **Operating Systems**, **Computer Networks**, etc.

These technical fundamentals must be mastered thoroughly, as technical positions will generally inquire about these basics.

### **Practical Skills Are Important**

Action, action, action – I can't emphasize this enough. People in technical roles cannot rely solely on words; being able to implement is most crucial.

Besides asking you about foundational knowledge and projects, interviewers will also assess your practical abilities. The interview time typically isn't too long, and will often involve writing some algorithm questions depending on the position.

In Alibaba interviews, you're not given exceedingly difficult algorithm problems.

The goal is primarily to evaluate your practical skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of data structures.

Through my coding experience, I have summarized my own methodology:

- Don't start by writing immediately; first analyze the problem and ask for clarification on the question's intent. Avoid making assumptions without understanding; it's a very good habit in the workplace to communicate needs, clarify requirements, and raise questions and suggestions.
- Then, articulate your thoughts. If your approach is incorrect, rewriting halfway through will waste a lot of time.
- After clearly describing your thought process, first write the steps of your coding thoughts in comments. While writing comments, iterate over whether your thinking is correct and if it's the optimal solution.
- Lastly, adhere to coding standards.

## Aside from These Conventional Aspects

In fact, interviews have become very **intense**; much of what’s been discussed is just **formulaic**.

Some students acquire numerous interview questions and answers and memorize them repeatedly. When an interviewer asks a question, they search for an answer in their head.

I typically know if a student is just reciting formulaic responses after asking a few questions.

I genuinely feel saddened for students who rely on rote memorization.

Even if you remember everything well, it doesn't justify passing; one must be responsible to oneself and the company!

Understanding a knowledge point is far more valuable than memorizing it. Grasping one concept can help you understand many others, and many knowledge points together form a knowledge system.

When interviewers ask about any topic within that system, you should be able to articulate the entire framework rather than just **reciting**.

I pay close attention to a deep understanding of issues.

During my interviews, I ask a series of questions rooted in a single theme, gradually connecting the entire framework.

Your **competitions** and **papers** are your highlights; these elements are significant bonus points.

I also weave some **open-ended questions** into the interview—they are thought exercises that test how a candidate thinks through problems.

## Finally

As an interviewer, I want to say that every company is eager for talent and hopes to find the most suitable people for its development.

During the interview, interviewers will try their best to uncover your value.

However, time is limited during interviews, and candidates must demonstrate their **capabilities** and **infinite potential** within that time.

In conclusion, I wish you all the best in finding your ideal job!
