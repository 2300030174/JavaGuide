> **Recommendation**: I often hear from friends who have attended training classes about how their teachers taught them to "package" themselves. It's not just in training classes; many friends I know also "package" themselves before interviews. This phenomenon is widespread. However, interviewers are not fools. Let’s take a look at how interviewers identify the degree of candidate packaging through the following article.

## Introduction

From experienced professionals to newcomers in the workplace, everyone will encounter the term packaging resumes. When your resume lands in your ideal company, how do the staff in charge of recruitment discern the degree of your resume packaging? I have written this article based on my own experiences. No one is a genius; packaging is understandable, so don't take it personally!

## Main Text

In the context of the rapid expansion of the internet, the number of IT workers entering various industries has been steadily increasing.

Back in 2016, my company published job postings for Java and iOS engineers. Just for the Java engineer position alone, we received nearly 200 resumes per day, and for iOS, almost a thousand.

Indeed, this is the result of market campaigns initiated by training institutions targeting the iOS engineer position. However, in recent years, the oversupply in the market has become increasingly severe. Evaluating personnel has become a significant difficulty for employers in talent assessment.

My first communication with a job seeker in the form of an interview occurred in June 2015. At that time, due to my short industry experience, I missed some excellent candidates.

Three years later, today, my company has expanded, which has led me to engage more deeply with job seekers.

### 1. How to Identify Poor Quality Resumes During Initial Screening

Besides providing technical training, training institutions often offer **resume writing guidance** and **interview coaching**. Many subtle factors are tough to discern. However, resumes packaged by training institutions typically exhibit uniform characteristics.

**Young but possess advanced degrees**

While being young and possessing advanced degrees may not be a definitive standard, most candidates appear to conform to traditional educational backgrounds. Individual tech enthusiasts might obtain degrees through self-study, in which case they need to present unique technical highlights.

**Old but with virtually no technical experience**

This issue is more severe than the previous one. It's well-known that an individual's ability to accept new things generally declines with age, including internet technologies. If an older person lacks technical experience, only two scenarios could explain this:

1. They changed careers midway (forcing their way in through training or self-learning).
1. Due to capability issues, they do not dare to include their existing experience on their resume (their skills do not align with their experience/salary).

**Project experience mostly comprises management systems**

Project experience is an essential criterion for evaluating a candidate's level. With the rapid iteration of the internet, numerous innovative internet companies and emerging industries arise each year. In my recent recruitment requests, 90% of responses focused on CRM systems, e-commerce, management systems, survey systems, and classroom systems. Is internal management so popular now in 2019? To evaluate resumes, we should consider projects that are "real." For instance, if an individual was employed by Company XX at the time and that company indeed developed the project (excluding outsourcing).

**Project backgrounds not aligning with internet development trends**

Project backgrounds vary with market directions each year, from early years of e-commerce and lottery issues to later O2O, treasure-hunting, live streaming, and new retail trends. Each series of products arises to meet market definitions. If resumes mention projects initiated in 2018 or 2019 related to lotteries (which were banned in 2015), O2O, e-commerce, treasure-hunting (which was prohibited in early 2017), live streaming, etc., it clearly does not match market demands. In this case, we must assess whether any misunderstanding could exist.

**Lack of innovation**

If a candidate describes multiple projects with the same technical architecture or project structure, this suggests a lack of innovation. Generally, different companies have different tech stacks, and even product direction and models differ entirely. Therefore, when a candidate cites the same technology across multiple projects at various companies, the appearance of tidiness masks a lack of persuasiveness.

**Too focused on new technologies, with no mention of old technologies**

When observing the evolution of internet technology, we continuously align with new technologies. However, any veteran CTO or architect in a company typically opts for more stable, mature, and lower-cost learning technologies. The pursuit of new technologies will not be overly evident. Conversely, training institutions tend to teach whatever technology is trending. Hence, many newcomers to the internet industry lack even basic knowledge of established technologies.

**Rich work experience but engaged in low-level work**

Having considerable work experience but engaged in low-level roles poses significant issues. It may indicate either that the prior company lacked the opportunity to provide better developmental pathways for the individual, or that the individual's skills were insufficient for more advanced work. There is also a scenario wherein excessive packaging of experience renders a resume discordant. Assessing the company’s scale and background becomes necessary in this situation.

**Company background crossing provinces and cities**

Many hiring entities, including myself, have recently noticed that 90% of resumes received involve individuals relocating across cities. Over 60% come from Wuhan XX Network Technology Co., Ltd., with all companies having fewer than 50 employees. Others hail from Xiamen, Ningbo, Nanjing, etc. This issue is self-explanatory; we all understand it. Cross-regional job-hopping is difficult to verify.

**Lack of passion for technology in personal projects**

Some overambitious technicians have completed several management systems yet have utilized a variety of distributed systems, clusters, high concurrency techniques, big data, message queues, search engines, image containers, multiple databases, and data centers—all while expecting salaries above industry standards. A genuinely passionate individual in technology would undoubtedly invest a considerable amount of personal time into it. Consequently, we can explore the candidate's blog, Git address, or even trace back their phone number, email, nickname, or pseudo name through search engines to verify whether the individual has a technical background in forums, discussion boards, or open-source organizations.

### 2. Entering the Interview Phase: How to Identify Their Fluff

Identifying fluff in a candidate's statements does not follow defined standards, but I can propose a few points based on my usual interview practices.

**Assessing the company’s size, team structure, reasonable personnel allocation, and collaboration methods to determine if the candidate possesses relevant work experience**

When hiring junior or mid-level IT personnel, it can be beneficial to pose inquiries regarding the company’s size, the size of the product team, and distribution across product, technical, backend, frontend, UI, and testing roles. Understand how collaboration occurs, how long the product has been under development, when it was launched, the frequency of version iterations, the duration of activity iterations, the number of users (backend), and peak concurrency (backend). According to my experience, if a person lacks any practical experience, they will typically provide off-the-mark answers or give irrational responses when faced with these questions.

**Verifying background company entry time, project initiation and completion times, product tech stack, and iteration processes**

Many candidates excessively embellish their resumes to pursue higher salaries. When we inquire: "You joined the company in xx year and xx month?" "Your project went live in xx year and xx month?" "What technology did your project use?" "How do you typically review your releases?" Candidates often provide answers that conflict with the information on their resumes. This prompts questions regarding the technology used in projects. We can generally assess utilized technologies through project addresses or apps, leveraging HTTP protocol, technical characteristics, and exceptional traits. If candidates provide responses that obviously do not match, that is telling.

**Assessing technical depth to gauge the candidate's technical level**

1. Determine the candidate's tech stack: For example, "What project are you most satisfied with, and why?" "What technologies do you prefer to use, and why?"
1. Assess the product's developmental stage: "How long has your product been in development, how many iterations have occurred, how many versions released, what is the current user count, and what peak concurrency are you handling?"
1. Identify the candidate's technical networking habits: "What channels do you use to interact with other technical individuals, and what technologies have you primarily communicated about?"

Recently, many candidates presented resumes filled with an array of technologies. To avoid stepping outside the candidate’s expertise, I specifically focus on the technologies mentioned in their resumes when forming my inquiries. Here are a few examples.

**1) A candidate claimed proficiency in Redis.**

1. Describe the Redis data structures you have used and their business scenarios;
1. Explain the plugins you used to manipulate Redis;
1. Clarify the serialization methods employed;
1. Discuss any significant issues you encountered while using Redis;

**2) A candidate asserted familiarity with HTTP protocols and claimed to have written web crawlers.**

1. Describe the HTTP headers you are familiar with and their purposes;
1. If a frontend submission succeeds but the backend cannot receive the data, how would you troubleshoot this issue?;
1. Explain the basic structure of an HTTP message;
1. If the server returns a Cookie, what header field in the response contains it?;
1. What does it signify if the server returns `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`?;
1. Can you describe segmented loading and its technical process?

Of course, the technical depth will vary based on the specific technologies involved.

The general approach is as follows: If you claim to have slaughtered pigs, I’ll surely ask how many pigs, at what times, and the sizes and colors of them. The responses might be: "I’ve slaughtered dozens, some weighing fifty pounds, and they’ve been green, yellow, red, and blue." Yet, issues arise when a candidate claiming to have used Git for two years is unaware of GitHub, or another has a year’s experience using Redis without knowledge of data structures or serialization methods, or a specialist in web scraping fails to understand the meaning of `content-type`, or an individual using search engine technology cannot name two segmentation plugins while working with read-write separation in databases but knows nothing of synchronization delays, etc.

In conclusion, I believe that in the recruitment process, it is not forbidden for candidates to package themselves, but it is crucial to strike a balance. Although this article does not have a perfect ending, I have provided various experiences regarding interview failures. Ultimately, I found suitable partners. I also hope that all technical interviewers find their ideal IT partners that align with their product development needs soon.
