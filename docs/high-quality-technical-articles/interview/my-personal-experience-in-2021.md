## Basic Information

I am primarily focused on C++ backend development.

I joined ByteDance's Feishu client during the spring recruitment of 2021. Before joining ByteDance, I received offers from Baidu (audio and video live streaming) and passed the HR interview at Tencent PCG (Weishi, backend development) (but had not yet received an offer letter).

## Unsuccessful Spring Recruitment Process

### Spring Recruitment Internship Was Not Smooth for Me

The lab officially went on holiday on New Year's Day in January, but I continued to "work remotely" at home. The workload did not decrease, and I spent day after day testing and debugging our developed "streaming conference system."

On the third-to-last day of January, we held an online "year-end summary" meeting. At this point, I was basically saying goodbye to the lab work as a second-year graduate student and officially entered the review phase for spring recruitment.

I had already started preparing intermittently before February, mainly brushing questions on LeetCode. I could only solve a few questions a day, and later I even just symbolically brushed one question daily. This did not help much with my algorithm practice.

Starting in February, at the beginning of the month, I had only brushed about 40 questions on LeetCode. I squeezed out a few weeks to update the 8.x version of the handsome theme, which was another busy few weeks. It was officially released on New Year's Day, and after the Spring Festival, I gradually spent some time fixing bugs and releasing patches. February quietly slipped away.

### The Process of Finding an Internship

**Early March 2021**

At the beginning of March, I applied for Alibaba's early recruitment, but unexpectedly, Alibaba's early recruitment ended on March 4. The phone interview I had scheduled for that day was also canceled. During a lab meeting to synchronize progress after the semester started, I found that everyone else had progressed to the first, second, or third interviews, while I had not even submitted my applications.

**March 8, 2021**

I applied to ByteDance's Feishu.

**Early April 2021**

First interview with ByteDance, first interview with Tencent.

**Mid-April 2021**

First and second interviews with Meituan, second and third interviews with Tencent, and the third round of interviews with Baidu, which I passed.

**End of April 2021**

Third interview with Tencent and second interview with ByteDance.

**Early May 2021**

Second interview with Tencent and second interview with ByteDance, both of which I passed.

#### Alibaba

I first applied for DingTalk but was rejected during the resume screening due to poor performance on the aptitude test.

The second time was for Alibaba Mama's backend interview, a phone interview. I felt it went well, and I managed to solve the questions. During the final Q&A, I asked for suggestions on my interview performance, and the interviewer said it was best to know Java for Alibaba... After the call ended, I received a rejection...

At that time, I was really feeling a bit overwhelmed. I had the interview at 7:30 PM and had been studying all evening without eating...

So, I was destined to have no connection with Alibaba during the spring recruitment.

#### Meituan

The interviewer for the first interview at Meituan was really nice. It was quite relaxed because they were hiring for a Java position and did not ask about C++ knowledge. We chatted about some basic knowledge, and the latter half hour was about non-technical questions, such as who my favorite programmer online was, how to write elegant code, and recommended technical books. I mentioned that Wang Yin was a programmer I liked, and the interviewer smiled and said he liked him too. The atmosphere of the interview felt great.

During the second interview, the entire time was spent discussing one project on my resume, which lasted about 90 minutes. I felt that the interviewer seemed a bit hesitant about wanting to hire me, likely because I was a C++ developer transitioning to Java, which might have some associated costs. In the end, HR told me the result was pending, and a few days later, I was notified of my rejection.

#### Baidu

Baidu had a total of three rounds of interviews conducted in one afternoon, which was really intense. The first interview consisted of some basic C++ questions, where I wrote a problem and explained my thought process without running the code (if it had to run, it might not have worked :) ).

The second interview was also basic. The first question was
