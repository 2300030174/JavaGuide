Suddenly reminiscing, I also received offers from more than 20 major internet companies during my autumn recruitment back then. Looking back now, it feels a bit bittersweet, after all, no matter how many offers I got, I could only choose one. However, many friends have asked me to share my interview methods for the internet sector, so today I will detail the strategies with you all!

Now that the golden September and silver October have passed, the job hunt battlefield is filled only with fallen candidates. During this period, it’s time for retraining, always prepared for the upcoming golden March and silver April next year.

For students who have not yet graduated, March and April next year will be opportunities for spring recruitment and internships; for seasoned professionals, these months will also be the time to grab their year-end bonuses and prepare to leave.

Therefore, during this time, it’s essential to prepare and accumulate interview strategies and experiences as a foundation for next year's battles. This article will discuss how programmers should prepare for technical interviews.

Generally, the recruitment for technical positions in internet companies is set to 3 to 4 rounds of interviews, and some positions with fewer headcounts may undergo 5 to 8 rounds. Additionally, depending on the company, there may also be corresponding written tests before the interviews.

The multiple rounds of interviews include technical interviews and HR interviews. Relatively speaking, the technical interview holds more decisive importance in the overall recruitment process, whereas the HR interview mainly confirms the candidate's basic situation and professional qualities.

However, in some major companies, HR has a veto power, so each round of interviews should be well-prepared and handled. Technical interviews can generally be divided into five parts:

1. Self-introduction by both parties
1. Project experience
1. Professional knowledge assessment
1. Coding ability assessment
1. Candidate Q&A

## Self-introduction by both parties

Interviews often begin with a self-introduction. Many times, a clear and logically structured opening can set the atmosphere and rhythm for the entire interview.

**As candidates, we can provide directional information in our self-introduction to assist the interviewer in discovering our highlights and strengths**.

In fact, a self-introduction is not merely a recitation of basic personal information; it is an effective summary of the resume.

What does effective summarization mean? It implies extracting and integrating core keywords from the information in the resume. By summarizing in one paragraph, the interviewer can gain an overall understanding of your situation, thus guiding their follow-up questions.

## Project Experience

Project experience is a crucial aspect of the interview process, especially in social recruitment interviews. Generally, the higher the level of the position in social recruitment, the more emphasis is placed on project experience.

For typical campus hires, having a few high-fit and complete project experiences can become the highlight of the interview and is key to securing an `SP` or `SSP`.

However, preparing project experiences is not an easy task. Many people do not know how to describe their projects or how to demonstrate their advantages and highlights within their experiences.

Here are some suggestions for project experience:

**1. Efficient and Organized Description**

Project experience is usually the largest section in a resume, making it equally important during the interview. In your expression, ensure that the logic and clarity are apparent, allowing the interviewer to quickly grasp the overall idea of your project.

Many have heard of various principles for writing resumes, such as `STAR` and `SMART`. In reality, these principles can help standardize your expression logic.

The `STAR` principle is relatively straightforward and very effective for structuring your thoughts during the interview. The acronym `STAR` stands for `Situation`, `Target`, `Action`, and `Result`, which is broadly consistent with the logical structure used in writing papers or documents.

- `Situation`: The background of the project, where you need to clarify the reason, current situation, and starting point of the project. In simple terms, you should clearly describe the context of the project. For example, explain the reasons behind the establishment of a particular platform and the user pain points it addresses.
- `Target`: The project objectives, which describe the expected degree of achievement or completion of the project. **It’s best if there are quantifiable indicators and expected results.** For instance, performance optimization metrics, business benefits from architectural improvements, etc.
- `Action`: The methods or plans, which represent the specific actions taken to implement the project. This part is the most important during technical interviews and serves as the foundation for demonstrating the candidate's capabilities. **The methods or plans can be detailed based on the technology stack used, specifying which problems were solved by employing different technologies.** For example, specifying which frameworks or technologies were used for implementations, optimizations, or designs and what problems were addressed in the project.
- `Result`: The outcomes of the project. This part can showcase your reflections and insights after experiencing the project during the interview. This approach allows the interviewer to perceive your growth and introspection, which can be more impactful than simply stating the results.

**2. Sufficiently Prepare Project Highlights**

To be honest, most people may not have particularly outstanding projects, but that does not mean there are no highlights in their project experiences, especially in an interview.

During the interview, you can emphasize your project highlights through thorough preparation and deep reflection. Here are several directions to consider:

- Fully understand the business logic and technical architecture of the project
- Be familiar with the overall architecture and key designs of the project
- Clearly understand the architectural decisions made and the rationale behind them
- Have an in-depth knowledge of the components and frameworks involved in the project
- Be familiar with the pain points or longstanding bugs in the project and their solutions
- …

## Professional Knowledge Assessment

Experienced interviewers often dig deep into project experiences while also assessing your professional knowledge.

Professional knowledge, for programmers, pertains to the computer knowledge framework relevant to the intended position. For campus recruits, it largely consists of foundational computer knowledge; for experienced recruits, it pertains more to the skill tree related to the specific position.

Foundational computer knowledge primarily includes computer networks, operating systems, programming languages, and the like, which can be considered the basics. Although such knowledge may not be frequently used in actual work, it serves as a standard for interviewers to evaluate candidates’ potential.

The skill tree relevant to the position should be classified according to specific roles. **For example, for client-side positions, one might be questioned on their understanding of mobile operating systems, end performance optimization, client architecture, and cross-end frameworks. For positions related to live video, questions may cover audio and video processing and communications.**

Backend positions may lean more towards **high availability architecture, transaction theory, distributed middleware, and the architectural design principles of service-oriented, asynchronous, and scalable systems**.

In summary, the richer one’s work experience, the more in-depth their technical understanding of the position.

I won’t go into too much detail about how to prepare these technical points before the interview, as numerous study paths have already been clearly outlined.

I’ll focus on how to better express and clearly describe these points during the interview.

Here are some suggestions for professional knowledge assessment:

**1. Establish a Technical Knowledge Framework in Advance**

Before the interview, you can summarize the knowledge points you are familiar with and create a simple diagram categorized by different directions and fields. This serves to assist yourself in expanding and extending your knowledge during the interview.

The question-and-answer format of interviews often leaves a less favorable impression, so during the response process, be adept at using your established knowledge framework to broaden the technical breadth and delve into technical depth. This will not only guide the interviewer toward asking questions in areas where you excel but also help showcase as many highlights of yours as possible.

**2. Summarize Understanding by Combining Specific Experiences**

Technical points themselves can be quite rigid and cold; however, if you can describe them by combining hard technical points with specific cases, it will be much more engaging. It also demonstrates that you truly understand that knowledge point.

There is a vast array of interview resources available online, and sometimes you might just need to memorize questions to handle the interviewer's inquiries. However, interviewers are also aware of this and can easily discern whether you are merely regurgitating answers.

Therefore, combining specific experiences to explain and express your answers is an effective way to avoid being perceived as someone who merely memorizes answers. Some may wonder where to find such specific experiences.

This relies on daily accumulation; it is crucial to continually gather insights and observe various technical outputs from major companies. Experience doesn't have to be solely your own but can also be derived from summarizing other sources.

Furthermore, you can amalgamate experiences from your projects involving decision-making on technical selections and the iterative processes of technological solutions to articulate your points cohesively.

## Coding Ability Assessment

The coding ability assessment refers to what we commonly call "whiteboard coding," which is one of the aspects many students dread the most. Many believe that interview outcomes hinge solely on their coding performance, but that is not always the case.

**First and foremost, it’s essential to clarify that coding ability does not completely equal algorithm proficiency.** Many students may successfully solve algorithm questions during interviews, yet the overall assessment is that their coding ability is average. Conversely, other students may fail to pass the algorithm question, yet the interviewer still finds their coding ability acceptable.

Thus, it's crucial to distinguish between the two; coding ability is not solely synonymous with algorithm ability. From the company's perspective, solely using difficult algorithm questions to filter candidates holds no real value. After all, everyone understands that they may not solve many algorithms in their jobs years down the line.

Remember, solving algorithm questions is merely a means to validate coding ability and logical thinking.

Ultimately, while preparing for this aspect of the interview, practicing algorithm questions is indeed necessary, but one should not blindly pursue difficulty or rote memorization.

Here are some suggestions for interviews:

**1. Data Structures and Algorithm Concepts are Fundamental**

Algorithms are essentially products of logical thinking, so grasping algorithm concepts holds more significance than merely solving a specific question. Data structures serve as tools to implement algorithms, representing core programming abilities. Therefore, proficiency in both is foundational for coding assessments.

**2. Do Not Overlook Coding Standards**

This point is a reminder that even a very simple algorithm question can reveal your coding ability. This often reflects in adherence to basic coding standards. If you claim to have 3 years of programming experience but cannot even implement essential function encapsulation type protections, how can one trust you?

**3. Communication is Key**

Whiteboard coding is definitely not a closed-book exam; rather, it is a process of mutual communication. As mentioned earlier, assessing algorithms is also aimed at evaluating logical thinking capabilities. Therefore, sharing your thought processes and reasoning with the interviewer is far more important than simply writing down an answer.

Moreover, clearly communicating your thoughts beforehand and promptly questioning any ambiguities in the problem statement not only saves time for everyone but also leaves a favorable impression on the interviewer.

Additionally, the code you write must withstand scrutiny and questioning, and you should be able to explain it clearly. This also serves as a distinguishing factor between "reciting answers" and "truly understanding."

Lastly, if you find yourself unable to produce code, you can still express your thought process and engage in discussion with the interviewer. After all, the interview process is also a learning experience.

## Candidate Q&A

Typically, there will be a candidate questioning segment. If this is absent, it may mean they want you to go home and await news.

The questioning segment can actually be a crucial part of the interview since you can gain more concrete and authentic information about the company and the role from the interviewer.

This information can assist us in making more comprehensive and rational decisions, as job seeking is a two-way selection process.

## Bonus Points

Finally, here’s a reward for those who managed to read to the end. Let's talk about bonus points in interviews.

Many students might feel they have answered all questions during the interview yet still fail to secure a position or receive a low interview evaluation. This could very well be due to a lack of highlights throughout the interview; perhaps you are not lacking in skills, but there was nothing that moved the interviewer.

Interviewers typically evaluate candidates based on the following aspects:

**1. Communication**

Interviews, after all, are an art of questioning and expression, so your fluent communication and clear, organized thought processes can naturally enhance the interviewer's perception of you. Additionally, if you demonstrate the ability to apply one concept to another, it can indirectly prove your potential.

**2. Match Quality**

This point is unquestionable but easily overlooked. Many believe that candidates with low match quality are filtered out during the resume screening stage. However, interviewers also assess the candidate's alignment with the role during the interview.

This match quality is strongly correlated with work experience and closely linked to previous business and technology contexts. Particularly for certain specialized technical roles such as finance, investments, and audio-video related fields.

Thus, in an interview, if you have experiences and projects that demonstrate a high degree of alignment with the target role, be sure to elaborate on them.

**3. High Performance and Thinking Beyond the Role**

This aspect is somewhat incidental; not everyone can bring in strong performance and then switch jobs. However, strong performance from a previous job and a core role in key projects can enhance one's background.

Furthermore, if you can showcase abilities that exceed the basic requirements of the position in an interview, it can significantly attract the interviewer’s attention. For instance, possessing a certain level of technical vision, excellent planning skills, or in-depth insights into business directions can all serve as highlights.

**4. Depth or Breadth of Technical Knowledge**

Many have heard that the most sought-after professionals in the workplace are `T`-shaped talents. This refers to individuals who possess a certain breadth of knowledge while excelling in their area of expertise. Such talents are indeed rare, as they are able to manage their current work while unrestrictedly learning and contributing knowledge from other fields.

Moreover, **even rarer than `T`-shaped talents are the so-called π-shaped talents, who possess expertise in more than one area of proficiency. Such talents are highly coveted resources by companies.**

## Conclusion

Although interviews are processes for evaluating and selecting outstanding talents, they fundamentally remain a way for people to communicate and present themselves. Therefore, mastering effective interview techniques helps you gain more advantages.

This article primarily discusses methodologies; many "principles" we recognize as clear may be challenging to implement. You might encounter an interviewer who behaves unconventionally, or face difficulties in communication with them, not to mention potentially landing interviews for roles that aren’t a good fit.

In summary, in pursuit of what you desire, being well-prepared is never a disadvantage. I wish everyone can become `π`-shaped talents and secure the desired `offers`!
