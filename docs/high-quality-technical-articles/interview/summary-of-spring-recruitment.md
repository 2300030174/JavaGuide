## Background

When writing this article, I had already received the Tencent offer, and the spring recruitment was considered over. This time, I didn't apply widely for summer internships like I did last year for regular internships; I only applied to the three BAT companies. I received offers from Alibaba and Tencent, but ByteDance did not give me an interview opportunity, probably because my written test performance was poor.

I am a junior in college, from a non-prestigious university. My spring recruitment timeline was from February 20 to March 23, when I received the intention letter from Alibaba. However, after finishing the final technical interview with Ant Group on March 7, I did not have any more technical interviews, only two HR interviews, and spent the rest of the time waiting for offers. Initially, I sought a referral from a friend for a regular internship at ByteDance, but it is still under resume evaluation. Later, I applied for a summer internship in finance, but after the written test, I got stuck in the process. I was initially contacted by TiMi Studios at Tencent, but after failing the first interview, I was picked up by PCG and completed the process. I applied to many departments in Alibaba's early batch, and Ant Group completed the final interview first, which was recorded in the system, and I finally received the offer. This journey has truly been filled with ups and downs; I experienced feelings of inferiority due to my academic background, which made me consider pursuing a master's degree. In summary, it is essential to find a partner to study with, for example, @You Might Be a Fool, who is a classmate from my lab and also the team leader. This person is genuinely strong and has received offers from core departments at Alibaba. He provided me with a lot of help during my review.

## Purpose of Writing This Post

1. To write for myself: to summarize and reflect on my experiences and insights from the first three years of college and job hunting.
1. To write for friends still looking for internships: I hope my experiences and interview insights can provide you with some inspiration and help.
1. To write for juniors who, like me, dream of working at big companies: you still have a long preparation time. No matter what you have been doing, whether you have no goals, feel aimless, or haven't found the right direction, as long as you start now, find the right direction for your studies, and persistently study for a year or two, you can definitely achieve your dreams.

## My College Experience

Let me briefly talk about my college experience.

I have no papers, no competitions, no ACM, and I have no awards. My GPA is decent, not too poor, but not outstanding. I definitely cannot secure a recommendation for graduate school, and I probably won't pass the entrance exam either.

In my freshman year, I joined a studio. In the first semester, I self-studied C language and data structures, and started learning Java during the winter break. At that time, I didn't know how competitive Java was; I only heard that Java was good for finding jobs. This highlights the importance of information disparity. I only knew about front-end, back-end, and Android development, and I was indeed interested in back-end development. However, due to the information gap, I only knew that Java could be used for back-end development, not realizing that back-end development is actually a very limited concept. I later gradually learned about terms like back-end development and server-side development, and I didn't know that languages like C++ and Golang could also be used for back-end development, so I learned Java. But in fact, Java is more suitable for business applications, while C++ is more suitable for low-level and server-side development. Although I don't dislike business applications, I am more interested in OS and Network topics, which I will explore in my spare time.

### Learning Path

My learning path roughly went as follows: Java SE Basics -> MySQL -> Java Web (mainly including JDBC, Servlet, JSP, etc.) -> SSM (at that time, Spring Boot had already emerged, but I felt it was difficult to learn Spring Boot without a foundation in SSM, so I learned SSM first) -> Spring Boot -> Spring Cloud (although I learned Spring Cloud, I lacked practical project experience and didn't know how to use it; I
