Let me briefly explain the background. I graduated from an unknown 985 university with a master's degree in 2017 and joined Didi. At that time, I was also fighting for jobs with everyone on Niuke. In the second half of this year, I switched to Toutiao, continuing to work in backend development. I had no internship experience, so I consider it about two and a half years of work experience. During these two and a half years, I completed a promotion and changed companies. I have had happy and fulfilling times, as well as days of confusion and struggle, but I have smoothly transitioned from a workplace rookie to a senior slacker. Throughout this process, I have summarized some practical slacking experiences, some of which I realized myself, and some I learned from communicating with others. I would like to share them here.

## Learn to Think Deeply, Summarize and Consolidate

**The first point I want to make is to learn to think deeply, summarize and consolidate; this is the most important and meaningful thing in my opinion.**

**First, let's talk about deep thinking.** In the programmer community, you often hear comments like: _“My job has no technical content at all; every day it's just CRUD and writing if-else statements. What can I learn from this?”_

Setting aside some teasing and joking remarks, this may indeed be the genuine thought of some colleagues; at least I used to think this way. However, as I accumulated work experience and engaged in discussions with some high-level colleagues, I realized that this idea is actually very wrong. The perception that there’s nothing to learn is basically a result of lazy thinking. **Any seemingly insignificant task, as long as you think deeply about it, can lead to a vast ocean of knowledge if you dig a little deeper or broaden your perspective.**

For example, once a colleague told me that a service OOMed this week, and after a week of investigation, they found an issue with a defer statement, fixed a few lines of code, and went live, making it impossible to write a weekly report. Many of you may have encountered similar scenarios, which are quite representative. In fact, debugging is a process of discovering problems, troubleshooting, and solving issues, involving many steps such as triggering, locating, reproducing, root cause analysis, fixing, and reviewing. Spending a week on this task certainly involves continuous attempts and corrections, which provides ample room for thought. For instance, how did you narrow down the scope? What detours did you take? What analysis tools did you use? Regarding root causes, there are at least points to study such as Linux OOM, Kubernetes OOM, Go memory management, defer mechanisms, and the principles of function closures, etc. If none of these were involved and it still took a week to resolve the issue, then the review should have plenty of thoughts, and it wouldn’t be a problem to raise dozens of WHYs...

**Next, let’s talk about summarizing and consolidating.** I think this is also a common shortcoming among most programmers; they focus solely on getting the work done well but rarely abstract and summarize. As a result, after working for several years, the knowledge they possess is still scattered and lacks a system, making it easy to forget and leading to a narrow perspective and limited problem-solving abilities. It is very important to periodically summarize and consolidate; this is a process from technique to principle, which broadens
