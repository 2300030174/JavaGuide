## Preface

This year, I finally left the big chrysanthemum factory, with a salary of about 600,000 before leaving! In some circles, this is considered quite poor. Today, I finally have time to write about my career story, which serves as a summary and reflection on my nearly 8 years as a programmer.

In these 8 years, I have done some things right, but even more things wrong. I hope to record them here to help future generations, and I welcome private messages for communication. My writing may not be great, so please forgive me if some details are unclear; if there are discrepancies, just consider it part of the story I’m telling.

_PS: I would like to clarify a few questions here, so I won’t respond to comments one by one._

1. Regarding being a poor student, I did indeed have lower grades at USTC. This is mainly what I mean by "poor student," with no other implications.
1. Buying a house is a significant event in my life, and I believe it needs to be recorded and summarized. There will be information about buying a house and housing prices in this article. If you are averse to housing prices or speculation, please stop reading, and I apologize for wasting your time.

## 2013

### Joining a Satellite Research Institute at Shanghai Aerospace X Academy

I was born in 1986 and graduated from USTC with a software-related major in 2013. Since both of my parents are teachers, I was educated from a young age to study hard, find a stable "good job," and serve the country.

So, at graduation, I impulsively joined a satellite research institute at Shanghai Aerospace X Academy without serious consideration, merely following my parents' advice, which laid the groundwork for my departure five years later. Here’s my first piece of advice:

**If your family members are from an ordinary background, their advice on significant life events often reflects the mindset of the ordinary class. Their class is the result of their life decisions. If your goal is to rise above this class, it’s best to treat their advice as a reference only.**

In April 2013, I took a train to Shanghai, transferred to the subway, and arrived at the old Minhang area. Walking from the subway to the workplace, I noticed the buildings were quite old, and I thought to myself, "This is no different from my hometown, even though it’s Shanghai."

Upon arriving at the workplace, the teacher in charge of onboarding was very friendly. After filling out the paperwork, I was assigned a dormitory and given about 3,000 yuan as a relocation allowance. I was so excited at the time (a country kid who had never seen much money, please forgive me). With the relocation allowance, I bought daily necessities at a nearby supermarket, and thus began my aerospace career.

After a month of intensive training, I was assigned to a department, mainly responsible for embedded software development on satellites. Although it was called high-end satellite software development, I initially did a lot of menial tasks, like moving equipment in the lab and factory. Many people in the aerospace field can relate to the physical nature of the work. However, being young and naive, I worked hard every day, voluntarily putting in overtime, reading documents, drawing software flowcharts, and practicing programming. Life felt very fulfilling.

I remember my first month's salary was about 5,000 yuan (so little!). Many of my colleagues who joined at the same time complained, but I didn’t. I was even reluctant to compare salaries with them. Here’s my second piece of advice:

**Don’t compare salaries with your colleagues; it’s meaningless. There will always be someone hurt by salary comparisons, and more often than not, it will be you who gets hurt.**

### Starting to Stand Out at Work

About a month into my job, I encountered an event that allowed me to start standing out among the new employees. The situation was that the country was going to conduct GJB5000A software development level certification for military enterprises (those who have gone through this certification know how rewarding it is). However, a colleague responsible for configuration management decided to leave because he passed the civil service exam. At that time, we were using a software
