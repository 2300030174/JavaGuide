## Summary of Huawei OD Work Experience

### Why I Went to Huawei OD

I only stayed at Ping An Property & Casualty Insurance (as a full-time employee) for 3 months before jumping to Huawei OD, which my friends found hard to understand â€” why leave a stable job for an outsourcing position? ðŸ˜‚

But at that time, I was determined to work in big data and didnâ€™t want to deal with endless CRUD operations. Coincidentally, the position I interviewed for was in the big data department of Huawei Cloud BU, working on a big data platform that is absolutely leading in usage among domestic government and enterprise sectors...
The platform and work content were great, such a good opportunity, I had to go! ðŸ’ª

> I actually considered transferring to big data internally at Ping An, but I didnâ€™t meet the requirement of "more than one year of employment";
> "Waiting is wasting life," so I quickly left before my probation process was approved. ðŸ˜‚

### Work Content at Huawei OD

**With great expectations, I rushed to report to Huawei.**

As the HR who recruited me said, I worked alongside Huawei's own employees, and the work content was exactly the same as theirs:

> The supervisor assigns work based on your ability level, gradually increasing the difficulty, with more work for those who can handle it;
> The probation period is 6 months, with a mentor who is usually a Huawei employee two levels above you, and they are generally experts in the department.

So, **there is no concern that outsourcing work is all basic, procedural, and lacks technical content** â€” you donâ€™t need to worry about this at all; you just need to find out what the specific department/group you are going to work in does, and if you can accept it, then consider the rest.

One thing that struck me deeply is: Huawei is a giant with nearly 200,000 employees, and there are many processes and systems internally. The benefit is that you can access the entire process of a large company's products from development, testing, to release and operation, for example, when submitting code, it will be reviewed by experienced, internally certified experts, and during review meetings, you can learn their perspectives on problem-solving and their overall grasp of the product.

However, I also feel that there are downsides: cumbersome processes can lead to lower work efficiency, for example, if you change a few lines of code, you need to run the entire CI (which can take a long time), and you also need to provide self-verification and VT reports.

### Comparison Between OD and Huawei Employees

What is OD? Outstanding Dispatcher, personnel dispatch, the official emphasis is that OD is different from the commonly referred to "outsourcing."

Hereâ€™s what I know about OD:

- Referring to Huawei's compensation framework, the salary system for OD personnel has a certain market competitiveness â€” indeed, it seems to be slightly lower than that of equivalent full-time employees;
- You can participate in the development of Huawei's main products â€” yes, this is also different from the "suppliers" like certain software companies;
- External network permissions can also be applied for (yes, thatâ€™s a VPN), and most internal documents in the department can be accessed;
- Employee numbers are in a separate 300 range, while other supplier employees have numbers starting with 8 or WX;
- The employee card is red, the same as full-time employees, but the content is different, clearly marked as: office area access pass, with a note from the staffing company:

I also heard some internal comments:

- No stock options, no TUP, fewer year-end bonuses, only salary might be slightly higher than my company;
- Cannot borrow consumer loans targeted at HW, nor can buy the discounted insurance provided by the company...
