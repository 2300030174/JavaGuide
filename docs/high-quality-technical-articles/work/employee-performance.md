After spending a complete Q3 in a new company, I have been evaluated on my performance and have also evaluated my subordinates, which has left me with a lot of thoughts.

Today, let's discuss **the performance evaluation that workers in big companies care about the most**, exploring the logic and unspoken rules behind it. Understanding this will help you survive better in the jungle of big companies.

## How Important is Performance Evaluation in Big Companies?

First, let's talk about why performance evaluation is necessary from the company's perspective.

There is a famous saying by a management expert: the upper three levels and the lower three levels of corporate strategy.

> The upper three levels are mission, vision, and values; the lower three levels are organization, talent, and KPI. The lower levels need to ensure that the upper levels can be executed; otherwise, it is just empty talk. So how can this be achieved?

At a class at Lakeview University, Boss Ma told a group of CEOs, "It can only rely on KPI. Without KPI, everything is just empty talk, and the organization and company will not progress."

Therefore, KPI is generally used to implement corporate strategy. Workers in big companies can deeply feel how each quarter's KPI is broken down from the big boss to the boss and then to the grassroots level, ultimately guiding everyone to act in the same direction. This is the significance of KPI for the company.

However, not every employee will understand the value of KPI from the CEO's perspective; they are more concerned about what KPI means for them personally.

In internet giants, every company sets up a performance evaluation system. ByteDance uses OKR, while Alibaba uses KPI, typically following the "271" system, which means:

> 20% are A+ and A, corresponding to star employees.
>
> 70% are B, corresponding to average employees.
>
> 10% are C and C-, corresponding to employees who need performance improvement or are to be eliminated.

With this ranking system, benefits can then be distributed.

**In big companies, performance results are directly related to bonuses, promotions, salary increases, and stock grants. In today's competitive environment, they can even be equated.**

Employees with good performance will naturally receive more bonuses, may have salary adjustments twice a year, and can outperform average performers during promotion discussions. Those with lower performance may end up working a whole year for nothing or even be let go (the elimination of the bottom performers is an unwritten rule in big companies).

In summary, all the direct benefits you can think of are closely related to "performance." Therefore, in the jungle of big companies filled with skilled individuals, understanding the logic behind performance is not only a survival strategy but also a valuable skill.

## How Do You View Performance Evaluation?

Most people subconsciously want to break the rules used to evaluate them rather than be constrained by them.

At least in my first few years of work, when I saw some colleagues leave quietly due to receiving a C rating, I thought performance evaluation was a cold-blooded management tool.

Especially when encountering a leader I didn't respect, I was quite dismissive of the performance rating they gave me.

Today, having seen too many negative examples and having stumbled into some pitfalls myself, I gradually realized that my initial thoughts, aside from providing a momentary sense of satisfaction, seemed to have no real effect and even distorted my work approach.

As my mindset changed, so did my attitude toward performance evaluation. At least two points need to be clear for workers.

**First, your immediate supervisor and their supervisor have absolute authority over your performance evaluation; this is an unspoken rule that applies to any company.**

You can observe that those who develop particularly well around you, besides having strong personal abilities, are almost always adept at utilizing the rules rather than challenging them.

Of course, I am not saying you should blindly flatter your leaders; rather, I mean that you should not position yourself in opposition to your leaders at work. If your leader's actions are excessive, either communicate directly to influence
