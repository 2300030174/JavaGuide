## Shortcuts to Growth

- A humble attitude at the beginning of your job is good, but don’t treat “I am a newcomer” as a psychological safety net.
- It takes about two weeks to write a technical blog, but it might be the fastest way to grow.
- Make sure to read two books: The Pyramid Principle and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (though it sounds like a book on success, it actually discusses how to shape character).
- Ask “what” and “why” frequently; trace issues back to their roots to solve problems. The issues you try to bypass will always be waiting for you at the next turn.
- Don't get trapped in a false sense of security from busyness; having clear goals and pursuing them is the only real safety.
- Don’t get overly hung up on short-term gains and losses. In a fair environment, taking a loss can be a blessing, not a cliché.
- Don't limit your thinking and skills to front-end, back-end, testing roles; position yourself as the problem-solver in the business domain.
- Curiosity and passion are the biggest shortcuts to growth; long-term thinkers will recognize their work's value, even exceeding the acknowledgment (KPI) given by the organization.

## Efforts in Daily Routine

- Every line of code should represent your highest current standard. The small details that you think are unimportant can potentially harm your promotion chances.
- Bi-weekly reports should not be a mere log of tasks. Don’t let time push you along; at the very least, know what will be in your next bi-weekly report (driven by small goals).
- If you feel that daily work is trivial, untechnical, or just assisting others, try categorizing your tasks. Imagine each category as a small box; the connection of these boxes leads to your ultimate goal. This makes your daily activities less mechanical and more planned, pushing you toward your goals. You may even find yourself adding tasks as you clarify where you want to go.
- Daily behaviors serve as a microscope for abilities. Most people may not realize how obvious their strengths and weaknesses are. Don't attempt to cover them up unnecessarily, nor try to cheat your way through.

> The last point roughly means that sometimes we care too much about our performance under the spotlight (reviews, promotions, reports, etc.), thinking others will evaluate us based on this. In reality, how we fulfill business requirements, help our peers, and create value is what others use to assess us. Moreover, what qualities each person possesses can be accurately evaluated by partners you have worked with multiple times; performances under the spotlight only deceive oneself.

## Learning to be Managed

> Superior, supervisor is a general reference, including the relevant PD managers in development.

- Don’t spread negative emotions; avoid constant complaining.
- Being neither servile nor arrogant towards your superiors makes it easier to gain respect, but don’t publicly refute their views; resolve disagreements privately.
- Manage upwards effectively, especially in aligning expectations. If surprises arise in performance discussions, both parties share the responsibility, but often it’s the individual who suffers.
- Try to think from the supervisor's perspective:
  - This understanding can clarify many decisions that previously seemed unreasonable.
  - Don’t care about who executes or where credit is due; alleviating team worries and earning your supervisor’s trust is far more important.
  - Do not interpret this principle as being excessively subservient; this is the most despicable.

## Shifting Mindset

- Defining problems is a high-level ability; establish the mental loop of discovering a problem -> defining the problem -> solving the problem -> eliminating the problem as early as possible.
- Focus on value when defining tasks, results when executing tasks, and problems when discussing tasks.
- If you can’t explain something clearly, it’s probably not because you are action-oriented, but rather because you haven’t thought it through, which becomes more obvious in promotional contexts.
- When someone excels at solving a particular problem, over time, they may find it difficult to detach from that scenario (once a label is pinned on someone, it’s challenging to remove it).

## Managing Emotions

- Learn to control your emotions; no one takes an angry person seriously.
- Stay rational, no matter how wronged or angry you feel; avoid becoming someone who needs to be coddled.
- Only those who are sufficiently confident can openly admit their own issues. Often, we get angered simply because someone pointed out our deep-seated insecurities.
- What hurts us most is not others' actions or our mistakes, but our responses to those mistakes.

## Becoming a Leader

> Managers have subordinates, while leaders have followers. You don’t need many managers, but anyone can be a leader.

- The person you trust and want to follow is not necessarily a positional manager but someone who helps you in your growth; a good leader shares the same rationale.
- Avoid hastily making negative judgments about others; misinformed opinions can be inaccurate, and carelessly sharing them can upset others significantly.
- If a leader does not resonate with the company’s mission, vision, and values, they will have a particularly difficult time.
- In challenging times, do not deny your teammates; provide timely and positive feedback.
- The most important thing for a captain is not to build the ship but to inspire sailors' longing for the sea.
- A leader’s inherent duty is to ensure the team thrives, and the only way to achieve this is to meet the objectives set by superiors, bosses, and company owners, with this becoming even more evident during tough times.
- A key responsibility of a leader is to identify what needs to be done within the team and steadfastly guide everyone to action, especially in challenging times.
- A leader should make everyone they encounter feel important and needed.
