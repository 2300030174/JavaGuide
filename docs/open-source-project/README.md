Selected high-quality Java open source projects on GitHub and Gitee.

Inspired by the project [awesome-java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java), this can be seen as the Chinese local version of that project, with a more comprehensive range of project types and additional Chinese open source projects.

Everyone is welcome to recommend Java open source projects they recognize in the project's [issues section](https://github.com/CodingDocs/awesome-java/issues), so we can collectively maintain a high-quality collection of Java open source projects!

If the content is helpful to you, feel free to give this project a Star. I will continue to improve this list in my spare time, thank you!

Additionally, my public account will regularly share high-quality open source projects, with one issue per month, each featuring 5 high-quality Java open source projects.
