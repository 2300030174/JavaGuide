## Project Build

- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): A software project management and comprehension tool that utilizes the concept of Project Object Model (POM). Maven can manage project builds, reports, and documentation from a central piece of information. For more details: [Summary of Maven Core Concepts](https://javaguide.cn/tools/maven/maven-core-concepts.html).
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/): An open source build automation tool that is flexible enough to build almost any type of software. Gradle makes few assumptions about what you want to build or how to build it, making it particularly flexible. For more details: [Summary of Gradle Core Concepts](https://javaguide.cn/tools/gradle/gradle-core-concepts.html).

## Decompilation

- [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx): A command-line and GUI tool for generating Java source code from Android Dex and Apk files.

## Database

### Database Modeling

- [CHINER](https://gitee.com/robergroup/chiner): An open source, free domestic database modeling tool. The goal is to create a rich database ecosystem, independent of any specific database, as a platform for designing database relational models. It originated from [PDMan](https://gitee.com/robergroup/pdman), positioned as a free alternative to PowerDesigner.

There are relatively few open source database modeling tools. Here are some non-open source database modeling tools (some require payment to use):

- [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/): A visual tool provided by MySQL for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench supports data modeling, SQL development, as well as server configuration, user management, performance optimization, database backup, and migration. It supports Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms.
- [Navicat Data Modeler](https://www.navicat.com.cn/products/navicat-data-modeler): A powerful and cost-effective database design tool that helps users create high-quality conceptual, logical, and physical data models. It allows you to visually design database structures, perform reverse or forward engineering, import models from ODBC data sources, generate complex SQL/DDL, and print models to files, etc. Paid.
- [DbSchema](https://dbschema.com/): A powerful visual tool for database design and management that supports almost all relational and NoSQL databases. Paid.
- [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home): A simple and free online ER diagram drawing tool that allows you to create models by writing code, designed specifically for developers and data analysts. It generates data models through a simple custom language, supporting forward engineering and reverse engineering of MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server database DDL files, version history, online sharing, and exporting images or PDFs, etc. dbdiagram.io offers a free version.
