## Introduction

**"Java Must-Read Source Code Series"** is an internal booklet of my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md), which has compiled the source code of frameworks/middleware such as Dubbo 2.6.x, Netty 4.x, SpringBoot 2.1, and more. I will continue to organize more quality source code worth reading in the future.

With a clear structure and detailed content, it is very suitable for students who want to deeply study the source code of frameworks/middleware.
