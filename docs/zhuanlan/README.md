I welcome students preparing for Java interviews and those learning Java to join my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md). There is a wealth of valuable content! Though the fee is quite reasonable, the quality of the content in the planet is higher than attending training courses that cost thousands.

I have my own principles, I donâ€™t exploit others, I focus on quality content, and I genuinely hope to help you!
