## Introduction

**"Handwritten RPC Framework"** is an internal booklet of my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md), where I wrote 12 articles explaining how to implement a simple RPC framework from scratch using Netty, Kyro, and Zookeeper.

Though small, it is comprehensive; the project code is well-commented, clearly structured, and integrates Check Style for code structure, making it very suitable for reading and learning.

Through this simple project, you can learn the underlying principles of RPC and various Java coding practices. You can even use it as part of your graduation project or work experience, which is quite impressive! Compared to other candidates whose project experiences involve various systems, creating your own framework is sure to win the favor of interviewers.
