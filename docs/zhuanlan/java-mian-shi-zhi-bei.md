I spent three years writing "Java Interview Guide," focused on Java interviews. The content is of very high quality and is highly suitable for friends preparing for Java interviews!

Current achievements: over **2.7 million** reads, **3550+** likes, and **1130+** comments (I make sure to respond carefully to almost every question-type comment I see).

## Introduction

**"Java Interview Guide"** is an internal booklet for my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md), complementing the content of the [JavaGuide open-source version](https://javaguide.cn/). Compared to the open-source version, "Java Interview Guide" includes the following (and not limited to these) content:

- 17+ articles providing step-by-step guidance on how to prepare for interviews, with 50+ detailed explanations of common questions in the interview preparation process, helping you prepare for Java interviews more efficiently.
- A more comprehensive set of standardized interview questions (system design, scenario questions, common frameworks, distributed & microservices, high concurrency, etc.).
- A selection of high-quality interview experiences (the quality of the interview experiences compiled in "Java Interview Guide" is higher than those from platforms like Niuke.com or other sites, and I will provide valuable reference materials).
- Self-assessment for technical interview questions (one effective way to prepare for technical standardized interviews is to self-test frequently and identify gaps).
- Leveling strategies (experience sharing that aids personal growth).

"Java Interview Guide" will be updated annually according to interview situations to ensure the timeliness of content quality. Moreover, you only need to join the [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md) once to gain permanent access to "Java Interview Guide," with continuous updates and improvements.

## Content Overview

### Interview Preparation Section

In the **"Interview Preparation Section,"** I wrote 17+ articles providing step-by-step guidance on how to prepare for interviews, along with detailed explanations of 50+ common questions during the interview preparation process. Common questions encountered during the preparation are addressed here, covering project experience, resume writing, source code learning, algorithm preparation, interview resources, etc.

Additionally, considering that many friends lack project experience, I also recommend many niche yet high-quality practical projects, including videos and open-source projects, as well as various high-value wheel projects.

### Technical Interview Questions Section

The **"Technical Interview Questions Section"** complements the JavaGuide open-source version, including not only the basic standardized Java and common framework content but also advanced topics like system design, distributed systems, and high concurrency.

### Interview Experience Section

As the saying goes, "**Using the stones from other hills to attack my own jade**." Learning from the successful experiences or failures of others can help you avoid many detours.

The **"Interview Experience Section"** mainly shares high-quality Java backend interview experiences, including campus recruitment, social recruitment, major companies, and small to medium-sized firms.

If you are a non-computer major student, you can find corresponding interview experiences written by fellow non-computer majors in these articles.

Compared to interview experiences on platforms like Niuke.com or other sites, the interview experiences compiled in "Java Interview Guide" are of higher quality, and I will provide valuable reference materials.

In addition, the [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) has a special topic dedicated to sharing interview experiences and interview questions, which includes many high-quality interview experiences and questions.

### Technical Interview Self-Assessment Section

To allow everyone to self-assess and check their understanding, I also launched a series titled **"Technical Interview Self-Assessment."** However, only the self-assessments for Java and databases have been updated so far and are continuously being updated.

One effective way to prepare for technical standardized interviews is to conduct frequent self-assessments and address any gaps.

### Leveling Strategies Section

The **"Leveling Strategies Section"** mainly contains experience sharing that aids personal growth.

Each article is very informative, and many readers have expressed that they gained a lot from it. However, the most important thing is still to integrate knowledge and practice.

### Work Section

The **"Work Section"** mainly shares content that is beneficial for personal and career development, as well as common problems encountered at work.
