## Introduction

**"High-Frequency System Design & Scenario Questions in Backend Interviews"** is an internal booklet for my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md) that contains common system design cases such as short link systems, flash sale systems, and high-frequency scenario questions like large-scale data deduplication and third-party authorization login.

In recent years, as technical interviews in the domestic job market have become increasingly competitive, more and more companies are beginning to assess system design and scenario questions during interviews to evaluate candidates more comprehensively, whether for campus recruitment or social recruitment. However, it is still rare for interviews to consist solely of scenario questions; interviewers typically sprinkle in one or two system design and scenario questions to assess you.

Therefore, I have compiled this "High-Frequency System Design & Scenario Questions in Backend Interviews," which includes common system design cases such as short link systems and flash sale systems, as well as high-frequency scenario questions like large-scale data deduplication and third-party authorization login.

Even if you are not preparing for an interview, I strongly recommend you read this series of articles carefully, as it is very helpful for improving your system design thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, many of the cases covered can be applied to your own projects, such as lottery system design, third-party authorization login, and the correct way to implement delayed tasks with Redis.

"High-Frequency System Design & Scenario Questions in Backend Interviews" is part of "The Java Interview Guide," and was subsequently extracted due to the large volume of content.
