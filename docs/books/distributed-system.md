## "In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Systems"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/deep-understanding-of-distributed-system.png)

**["In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Systems"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35794814/)** is a Chinese original book published in 2022, focusing on the basic concepts, common challenges, and consensus algorithms in the field of distributed systems.

The author dedicates a substantial portion of the book to discussing the very important consensus algorithms in the distributed field, and also guides you through the implementation of the ancestral Paxos algorithm from scratch using the Go language.

To be honest, I haven't started reading this book yet. However! I have carefully read almost every one of the articles related to distributed systems on the author's blog. The author began conceptualizing "In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Systems" in 2019 and started writing in 2020, spending nearly two years before finally submitting the manuscript.

The author has also written an article to introduce the story behind this book; interested friends can check it out: <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/487534882>.

## "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/ddia.png)

Highly recommend **["Designing Data-Intensive Applications"](https://book.douban.com/subject/30329536/)** (DDIA), a book well worth reading multiple times! Nearly 90% of readers on Douban have given this book a five-star rating.

This book mainly covers topics such as distributed databases, data partitioning, transactions, and distributed systems.

You may have heard most of the concepts introduced in this book before, but after reading its content, you might find yourself enlightened: "Wow! So that's how it is! Isn't that the principle behind a certain technology?"

I have previously written a Zhihu answer to introduce and recommend this book; if you haven't read it yet, you can take a look: [What programming books have made you shout in excitement after reading?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/50408698/answer/2278198495). Additionally, if you find the reading of this book challenging and difficult to understand in many places, I recommend the [“DDIA Chapter by Chapter Study Guide”](https://ddia.qtmuniao.com) written by the author of "In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Systems".

## "In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Transactions"

**["In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Transactions"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35626925/)** features one of the authors as the founder of Apache ShenYu (incubating) Gateway, as well as the founder of distributed transaction frameworks like Hmily, RainCat, and Myth.

When learning about distributed transactions, this book can serve as a useful reference. While it contains some minor errors and areas with logical inconsistencies, the overall introduction to various distributed transaction solutions is still commendable.

## "From Paxos to Zookeeper"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/image-20211216161350118.png)

**["From Paxos to Zookeeper"](https://book.douban.com/subject/26292004/)** is a good book to get you started on distributed theory. It mainly introduces several typical distributed consistency protocols and strategies for solving distributed consistency problems, with a focus on the Paxos and ZAB protocols.

PS: Zookeeper is not widely used nowadays, so it may not require in-depth study; however, the Paxos and ZAB protocols are still very worthwhile for thorough research.

## "In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Consensus Algorithms"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/deep-dive-into-distributed-consensus-algorithms.png)

**["In-Depth Understanding of Distributed Consensus Algorithms"](https://book.douban.com/subject/36335459/)** provides a detailed analysis of the core principles and implementation details of mainstream distributed consensus algorithms such as Paxos, Raft, and Zab. If you want to learn about distributed consensus algorithms, consider using this book as a reference.

## "Microservices Architecture Patterns"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/microservices-patterns.png)

**["Microservices Architecture Patterns"](https://book.douban.com/subject/33425123/)** is authored by Chris Richardson, recognized as one of the top ten software architects in the world and a pioneer in microservices architecture. This book compiles 44 practical architecture design patterns that address challenges such as service decomposition, transaction management, querying, and inter-service communication. The content of the book is not only solid in theory but also includes rich Java code examples, guiding readers step by step in mastering the development and deployment of production-level microservices architecture applications.

## "Phoenix Architecture"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/f5bec14d3b404ac4b041d723153658b5.png)

**["Phoenix Architecture"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35492898/)** is a summary of Teacher Zhou Zhiming's many years of architectural and development experience. The content is very rich, blending depth and breadth, and combines theory with practice!

As the subtitle of the book suggests, "Building Reliable Large-Scale Distributed Systems," the main content discusses: "How to build a reliable distributed large software system," covering aspects such as:

- The evolution of software architecture from monolithic to microservices to serverless.
- What architects should pay attention to during architectural design and good practices to follow.
- Foundations of distributed systems, such as common distributed consensus algorithms like Paxos and Multi Paxos.
- Immutable infrastructures such as virtualization containers and service meshes.
- A guide to avoid pitfalls when transitioning to microservices.

I have recommended this book many times. See my historical articles for more details:

## Others

- ["Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms"](https://book.douban.com/subject/21624776/): More textbook-like, with comprehensive yet tedious content, can be used as a reference book;
- ["Principles and Practice of Distributed Architecture"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35689350/): Published in 2021, it lacks interest, and I haven't read it yet.
