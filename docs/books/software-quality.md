Below are the books I have read and believe are worth recommending.

However, these books are more theoretical and can only help you establish a standard for writing excellent code. If you want to write higher quality code and better software, you should read more excellent source code and learn outstanding coding practices.

## The Clean Code

**[“Refactoring”](https://book.douban.com/subject/30468597/)**

A must-read! Need I say more? A gem in the programming book field.

A world-class, national treasure-level book by Martin Fowler, one of the most classic books in software development. The second edition has already been released.

This is a book worth reading several times.

**[“Clean Code”](https://book.douban.com/subject/4199741/)**

“Clean Code” is a classic work by Uncle Bob, and I strongly recommend that everyone take a look.

Uncle Bob distilled his understanding of clean code into this book, which is a significant gift to future generations.

**[“Effective Java”](https://book.douban.com/subject/30412517/)**

“Effective Java” is a national treasure-level book in the field of Java, and it is very classic. A must-read for Java programmers!

This book primarily introduces many practical experience rules in Java programming; these rules cover solutions to most problems developers face daily. This book can practically help you write clearer, more robust, and efficient code. Each rule in this book appears in the form of a short, independent article and is further illustrated with example code.

**[“Code Complete”](https://book.douban.com/subject/1477390/)**

In fact, I originally did not want to recommend “Code Complete (2nd Edition)” to everyone. However, given its high Douban rating, I decided to mention it!

This is also a very classic book, with the second edition rewritten from the first.

I briefly skimmed through the content of the book and felt that the content is generally superficial, and its usefulness for most programmers is limited. If you want to improve your code quality, I think “Clean Code” and “The Art of Readable Code” are better options than “Code Complete.”

However, the most important thing is still to read excellent source code and learn outstanding coding practices.

**[“The Art of Readable Code”](https://book.douban.com/subject/10797189/)**

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/20210314175536443.png)

“The Art of Readable Code” conveys ideas very similar to “Clean Code,” as you can see from their table of contents.

In my opinion, if you have read “Clean Code,” you do not need to read this book again. Of course, if you have time and energy, you can quickly skim through it.

Additionally, I want to recommend a repository called **[write-readable-code](https://github.com/biezhi/write-readable-code)**. The author of this repository shares a series of videos based on “The Art of Readable Code” for free. This series of videos will teach you how to optimize our code based on Java.

Learning in practice will definitely be more effective! I recommend everyone to start studying right away!

## Professional Qualities of Programmers

**[“The Clean Coder”](https://book.douban.com/subject/26919457/)**

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/20210314191210273.png)

“The Clean Coder” is another classic by Uncle Bob.

Both “Clean Code” and “The Clean Coder” are translated in China as “The Clean Code Way,” which I feel is not an elegant translation.

Additionally, the content differences between the two are quite significant. “Clean Code” discusses how to improve code quality from the code perspective, while “The Clean Coder” is focused on how to become a better developer, teaching you about professionalism in your field, how to say no, time management, stress handling, and more.

## The Clean Architecture

**[“Clean Architecture”](https://book.douban.com/subject/30333919/)**

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/2021031412342771.png)

You read that right, “Clean Architecture” is another classic by Uncle Bob.

I highly recommend this book! After reading it thoroughly, I assure you will gain a deeper understanding of the essence of programming, the nature of programming languages, software design, and architecture design.

Many books and columns in China have drawn inspiration from “Clean Architecture.” It is not an exaggeration to say that “Clean Architecture” is one of the most classic books in the field of architecture.

As the author states:

> If we delve into the essence of computer programming, we will find that there hasn't been much change in computer programming in the past 50 years. Programming languages have progressed slightly, tools have greatly improved in quality, but the fundamental structure of computer programs has not changed.
>
> Although we have new programming languages, new frameworks, and new paradigms, the rules of software architecture remain the same as they were when Alan Turing wrote the first line of machine code in 1946.
>
> This book is intended to present these timeless rules of software architecture.

## Project Management

**[“The Mythical Man-Month”](https://book.douban.com/subject/1102259/)**

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/2021/03/8ece325c-4491-4ffd-9d3d-77e95159ec40.png)

This book primarily describes the fundamental laws of software development: **A task that takes 10 days to complete cannot be done by 10 people in 1 day!**

At first glance, the book title seems unrelated to technical topics. However, such a seemingly non-programming title has become a long-lasting classic in the field of programming.

**This book has profound significance for the standardization of modern software, especially complex software development.**

**[“Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software”](https://book.douban.com/subject/5344973/)**

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/2021/03/7e80418d-20b1-4066-b9af-cfe434b1bf1a.png)

This classic work on domain-driven design has been recommended numerous times, but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet.

## Others

- [“The Future of Code”](https://book.douban.com/subject/24536403/): This book is authored by Yukihiro Matsumoto, the father of Ruby. It is relatively old (published in 2013), but it is definitely worth a read. The book’s content primarily discusses the essence of programming/programming languages. I personally appreciate Matsumoto's writing style, and his articles offer valuable insights.
- [“Understanding Design Patterns”](https://book.douban.com/subject/1488876/): A rather interesting style, suitable for beginners in design patterns.
- [“Software Architecture Design: The Integration of Technical Architecture and Business Architecture for Large Websites”](https://book.douban.com/subject/30443578/): Very comprehensive content. Suitable for cramming important theoretical knowledge before interviews, and also good for expanding/perfecting your technical breadth.
- [“Microservices Patterns”](https://book.douban.com/subject/33425123/): This book is authored by Chris Richardson, one of the top ten software architects in the world and a pioneer of microservices architecture, with a Douban rating of 9.6. The example code uses Java and the Spring framework. It helps you design, implement, test, and deploy applications based on microservices.
