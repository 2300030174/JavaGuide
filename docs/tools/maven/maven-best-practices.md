Maven is a widely used automation tool for building Java projects. It simplifies the build process and helps manage dependencies, making developers' work easier. For a detailed introduction to Maven, you can refer to my article [Summary of Core Maven Concepts](./maven-core-concepts.md).

This article will not cover the introduction of Maven concepts but will mainly discuss some best practices, suggestions, and tips to optimize our use of Maven in projects and improve our development experience.

## Maven Standard Directory Structure

Maven follows a standard directory structure to maintain consistency between projects. Adhering to this structure makes it easier for other developers to understand our projects.

The standard directory structure of a Maven project is as follows:

```groovy
src/
  main/
    java/
    resources/
  test/
    java/
    resources/
pom.xml
```

- `src/main/java`: Source code directory
- `src/main/resources`: Resource files directory
- `src/test/java`: Test code directory
- `src/test/resources`: Test resource files directory

This is just a simple example of a Maven project directory. In actual projects, we will further subdivide according to project specifications.

## Specify Maven Compiler Plugin

By default, Maven uses Java 5 to compile our projects. To use a different JDK version, configure the Maven Compiler Plugin in the `pom.xml` file.

For example, if you want to use Java 8 to compile your project, you can add the following code snippet under the `<build>` tag:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.8.1</version>
      <configuration>
        <source>1.8</source>
        <target>1.8</target>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

This way, Maven will use the Java 8 compiler to compile your project. If you want to use another version of the JDK, you only need to modify the values of the `<source>` and `<target>` tags. For example, if you want to use Java 11, you can change their values to 11.

## Effectively Manage Dependencies

Maven's dependency management system is one of its most powerful features. In the top-level pom file, define common dependencies through the `dependencyManagement` tag, which helps avoid conflicts and ensures that all modules use the same version of dependencies.

For example, suppose we have a parent module and two child modules A and B, and we want to use JUnit 5.7.2 as the testing framework in all modules. We can define the version of JUnit in the parent module's `pom.xml` file using the `<dependencyManagement>` tag:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
      <version>5.7.2</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

In the `pom.xml` files of child modules A and B, we only need to reference JUnit's `groupId` and `artifactId`:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Use Configuration Files for Different Environments

Maven configuration files allow us to configure build settings for different environments, such as development, testing, and production. Define configuration files in the `pom.xml` file and activate them using command-line parameters:

```xml
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>development</id>
    <activation>
      <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <properties>
      <environment>dev</environment>
    </properties>
  </profile>
  <profile>
    <id>production</id>
    <properties>
      <
