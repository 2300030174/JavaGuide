## Introduction to Maven

The [Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven) official documentation introduces Maven as follows:

> Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.

**What is POM?** Every Maven project has a `pom.xml` file located in the root directory, which contains detailed information about the project's build lifecycle. Through the `pom.xml` file, we can define the project's coordinates, project dependencies, project information, plugin information, and other configurations.

For developers, Maven mainly serves three purposes:

1. **Project Build**: Provides a standard, cross-platform automated project build method.
1. **Dependency Management**: Conveniently and quickly manages project dependencies (jar packages), avoiding version conflicts between resources.
1. **Unified Development Structure**: Provides a standard, unified project structure.

Basic usage of Maven will not be introduced here; it is recommended to check the official 5-minute tutorial on getting started with Maven: [Maven in 5 Minutes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).

## Maven Coordinates

Third-party libraries and plugins that a project depends on can be collectively referred to as artifacts. Each artifact can be uniquely identified using Maven coordinates, which include the following elements:

- **groupId** (required): Defines the organization or company to which the current Maven project belongs. The groupId is generally divided into multiple segments, with the first segment usually being the domain and the second segment being the company name. The domain is further divided into org, com, cn, etc., where org represents non-profit organizations, com represents commercial organizations, and cn indicates China. For example, the groupId of the Apache open-source community's Tomcat project is org.apache, where the domain is org (since Tomcat is a non-profit project), the company name is Apache, and the artifactId is Tomcat.
- **artifactId** (required): Defines the name of the current Maven project, which is the unique identifier corresponding to the name of the project root directory.
- **version** (required): Defines the current version of the Maven project.
- **packaging** (optional): Defines the packaging method of the Maven project (e.g., jar, war...), with jar being the default.
- **classifier** (optional): Commonly used to distinguish artifacts built from the same POM but with different contents; it can be any string appended after the version number.

As long as you provide the correct coordinates, you can find the corresponding artifact from the Maven repository for use.

For example (introducing Alibaba's open-source EasyExcel):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
    <artifactId>easyexcel</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

You can find almost all available artifacts on the website <https://mvnrepository.com/>. If your project uses Maven as the build tool, you will definitely come across this site frequently.

## Maven Dependencies

If an artifact (e.g., a Jar file) generated by Maven is referenced by other projects, then that artifact is a dependency for those projects.

### Dependency Configuration

**Configuration Information Example**:

```xml
<project>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId></groupId>
            <artifactId></artifactId>
            <version></version>
            <type>...</type>
            <scope>...</scope>
            <optional>...</optional>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                  <groupId>...</groupId>
                  <artifactId>...</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
          </exclusions>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
</project>
```
