It has been over a month since I joined the company. Before starting my job, I had never interned or worked at any company, so many things felt quite novel to me. The transition from school to the workplace brought about a shift in roles, which varies from person to person. For me, in school, the things taught by the teacher in class could be selectively absorbed based on my interests. In fact, if there were courses I didn't want to attend, I could even skip them. However, things are different at the company. The skills that the company requires you to have are necessary for you to learn, unless you don't want to continue. In school, most people's programming goal was either to pass exams or to land a good job; very few were genuinely driven by their interests. Once we entered the workforce, we found that we program more out of job requirements, which is generally more challenging and comes with greater pressure. In school, we were predominantly responsible for ourselves; we kept learning to empower ourselves. However, once we joined the company, we are not only responsible for ourselves but also owe responsibility to the company, as they are paying us to work, not to be idle.

When I first arrived at the company, I switched to a Mac computer as required. Since I had always used Windows, I found it very uncomfortable. At the beginning, I was clumsy using the Mac system and could clearly feel that my programming efficiency dropped by at least 30%. I was quite frustrated and often complained internally about why we couldn't just use Windows or Linux. However, after about a week, I slowly began to adapt to programming on a Mac and even grew to really like it. I don't want to compare which is better between Mac and Windows for programming, as it really depends on the individual. The specifications of a Mac at the same price point are indeed less powerful compared to Windows. However, the programming and usage experience on Mac is genuinely good; of course, you can also choose to use Linux for daily development, which I believe is also quite nice. Additionally, Mac doesn't support some mainstream online games, which can be a good choice for those who can't resist the urge to play games.

I have to say that ThoughtWorks has a great training mechanism. Generally, new graduates receive training after joining, and unlike past years, this year there is a local class (TWU-C). As a participant in the first local class, I can honestly say that it has been quite good. The 8-week training includes essential skills needed for work, such as ES6, SpringBoot, etc., as well as training on fundamental skills for new employees, like how to run efficient meetings, how to give proper feedback, how to refactor code, and how to do TDD. During the training, there are also various activities, such as Weekend Trips, City Tours, and Cake time. In the last three weeks, we also had a simulated project that closely resembled actual projects we would be working on. Personally, I felt it was quite excellent. This project has already officially completed one iteration, and I believe that the most significant gains from working on the project were not the technologies used but rather understanding teamwork, how to properly use Git for collaborative development, what a completed iteration looks like, potential problems that may arise during the project, and the complete workflow of a project, etc.

ThoughtWorks strongly advocates for sharing and helping others grow, and I've truly felt this during my time at the company. During training, each of us had a Trainer, colleagues who led us in classes and projects, typically responsible for 5-6 people. Trainers periodically provided us with feedback about our recent performance, and I believe these were not mere formalities; the Trainers were very responsible and often sought us out for discussions after work. My colleagues were also very helpful; if you encountered problems and asked others for help, they would usually share their knowledge generously. If a problem arose that few understood, it was common to organize a technical session to share knowledge. Last Friday, I conducted a technical sharing session about Feign remote calls within our group, as everyone was unfamiliar with this topic, but it would likely be necessary for our ongoing project. Since I had researched this area, I shared my findings with my colleagues to aid in the project's progress.

Moreover, ThoughtWorks is a company that highly promotes a culture of feedback. Feedback is about informing people of our perceptions of their performance and how they can improve. At first, I didn't pay much attention to it, but gradually I realized that providing accurate feedback can be significantly helpful to others. When people are engaged in many tasks, they often have trouble noticing small issues that others can easily see. For instance, an interesting phenomenon occurs during a project without testing certain roles; if you complete your module and have tested it many times without issues, you may think all is well. However, when it comes to actual use, significant problems may arise that you previously overlooked. This issue can be explained by the fact that everyone's perspective has blind spots, which is closely related to our focus. There are many places where you may test your own work repeatedly without noticing any problems, but if others assist in testing, they are likely to identify many apparent issues.

After starting work, I found that my time for updating my public account, columns, and maintaining GitHub had significantly decreased. In reality, quite often after work, I do have my own time to engage in personal pursuits; however, I often end up making excuses about being too tired from work or that my time is too fragmented. Today, while reviewing GitHub, I suddenly realized that I had not addressed a PR raised by someone else 14 days ago. This was indeed a place where I did not perform well; I hadn't managed my time effectively. I have many things I want to write about, and I will gradually prioritize them. After work, I have realized how important it is to spend the few hours after work effectively. If you feel you haven't completed your work during the day, you can continue working on unfinished tasks after hours. If you find your daytime work manageable, then when you return home, you should certainly engage in things that interest you and learn about technologies you are passionate about. Everything should be based on your own foundation, and one should avoid striving too high without adequate preparation.

After starting work, I also found myself surrounded by many talented individuals, and I believe that learning from others is something every professional should do. Among my training peers, some possess impressive technical skills, while others, although not technically superior, have exceptional organizational and teamwork skills. One particularly remarkable colleague wrote a simplified version of SpringBoot in his spare time while we were still learning various SpringBoot syntax. This version includes some commonly used Spring annotations like `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, `@PathVariable`, and `@RequestParam`, etc. (I have contacted this colleague and hope he will open source it soon; I will synchronize this on the public account as soon as possibleâ€”stay tuned!). I genuinely believe this colleague has a real passion for programming; he seems to have started programming in middle school and is very interested in various foundational knowledge, having developed many low-level elements himself. His dream is to create a library with over 20k stars on GitHub. I have no doubt that this colleague will achieve his goal, and I wish him all the best in reaching it soon.

These are my personal reflections after over a month of employment. I've touched on many aspects rather briefly, and in the future, I will take the time to share useful knowledge I've gained at the company or in my spare time. I hope that everyone who reads this can gain something from it.
