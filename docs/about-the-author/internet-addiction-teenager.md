When it comes to the college entrance examination, countless people seem to have a lot to say. Today, I’ll borrow the occasion of the examination to briefly talk about my high school experience!

To be honest, my own high school experience was not bland at all; it was even a bit fantastical, so I have a lot to share.

This article will probably cover my journey from middle school to high school. I won’t spend too much time on each part, just a simple chat!

**All the following content is factual, with no exaggerations, just a little bit of fantasy.**

## First Encounter with Computers

I first encountered computers when I was in the fifth grade. At that time, my family didn’t have a computer, and I started going online in an internet café.

The internet café was pretty much like this: a windowless room filled with many old computers, and it was very crowded.

The experience of going online in the internet café was full of twists and turns. I often encountered police checks or older kids harassing me. During the year I spent online in the internet café, I met police checks twice, mainly to see if there were any minors (almost all the patrons were minors). It felt like they were just looking to ask the café owner for some benefits. I often encountered older kids who would steal my computer and threaten me to give them all the money I had on me. I was pretty timid at that time, and after being beaten a few times, I made an effort to avoid going at times when older kids were around, and I would only bring a little money with me. I was quite independent as a child and generally wouldn’t tell my family about incidents I encountered outside (because it wouldn’t make much difference; there was little sense of security from my family).

I can’t quite remember whether it was my brother or sister who brought me into the internet café; it seems like it was my sister.

At first, I just played single-player games like "Butterfly Sword" and standalone motorcycle games. However, I didn’t reach an addictive level, just found them quite fun, spending entire afternoons reluctantly playing.

## Internet Addiction After Primary School Graduation

I started to get addicted to the internet when I graduated from primary school, after I played a game called **QQ Speed** (I think I started playing it at the end of sixth grade). Wow, I was really captivated by this game at that time. **Every day in class, I would fantasize about drifting in the car, thinking, no doubt, I was the king of Akina!**

I was quite skilled back then, and it seemed like no one in the internet café could defeat me (we often had friendly competitions).

QQ Speed was quite popular at that time, and many post-90s friends should be familiar with it.

I remember that back then, there was no need for an ID to go online; you just needed 10 yuan to get a network card, and the internet fee was 1 yuan per hour. I often skipped breakfast to save money for internet time. Whenever I had money in my pocket, I would rush to the café with my friends to play QQ Speed. Ah, the nostalgia!

> Speaking of this, I couldn’t help but open my Windows computer, download Wegame, and then download QQ Speed.

By the time I was in the second year of middle school, I stopped playing QQ Speed. My level was permanently fixed at **120**, which was considered quite high back in those days when leveling up was incredibly difficult.

## Internet Addiction Erupts in Second Year of Middle School

My internet addiction erupted after I entered middle school. In the second year, it was the peak; I was truly obsessed with the game **CrossFire**, even more than with QQ Speed. Every day during class, I would imagine myself with a gun sweeping through enemy camps, completely detached from studying.

I often woke up early each morning to play on machines left overnight by others since I didn’t have much money for school! Almost every Friday night, I would sneak out to play overnight after my family was asleep. I ended up pulling countless all-nighters throughout my second year, which is how I developed my nearsightedness.

Internet addiction is indeed terrifying; you would do anything to get online. At that time, I lived on the top floor in an insulated layer, and every night I would secretly climb out of my room’s window to avoid being discovered by my family. I would cross several buildings and pass through a few deserted top-floor insulation layers before heading downstairs. Thinking about it now, it was quite dangerous. Also, I was naturally afraid of the dark. Yet, I didn’t feel scared at all going through those deserted layers just to get online. If you made me do that now, I wouldn’t dare; I truly admire my former self!

After all-nighters on Friday, I would sleep until noon and then head to the café again in the afternoon. By Sunday, I’d typically play from 8 AM until 9 or 10 PM. My energy levels were truly high back then; I didn’t feel tired at all, rather, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

I ended up reaching two diamond ranks; those who have played should know how many matches it takes to achieve that (now leveling up is much easier).

Ps: I’ve returned to CrossFire for almost a year now, and my rank has reached two-star lieutenant colonel 3.

Back then, my grades were quite poor. To put it simply! I was in an ordinary high school in a county-level city with around 500 students in my grade, and I hovered around the 280th position. Moreover, throughout the entire second year, I didn’t study physics at all; I would sleep during physics class and turn in blank sheets for exams.

Why was I so resistant to physics? This was because, not long after school started, during one physics class, the teacher mistakenly thought I was eating during class and accused me, then slapped me. I held a grudge against that for years, thinking I would one day have the chance to pay back that physics teacher.

## Awakening to Study in Third Year

In the first semester of my third year, I suddenly had an epiphany, as if I was enlightened, realizing that I was about to graduate to high school and needed to start taking my studies seriously.

Well, actually, it wasn’t really an epiphany; it was mostly because I wanted to attend school near my home, making it easier to go online. My family lived near our local Second Middle School, which had many internet cafés, so going online was incredibly easy since I could be a day student.

In my middle school, students ranked in the top 80 had a good chance of getting into Second Middle School. After some effort, I improved from the 280th position in the first monthly exam of my third year to around 50th, making it possible for me to go to Second Middle School. I even became a **Star of Progress** and shared my experience with the whole grade on stage because of my significant improvement. This was also my first time speaking in front of so many people, and though I was pretty nervous, it felt great, especially in front of my crush.

Even though I still had a large internet addiction during my third year, I ensured that I completed all tasks and listened attentively in classes before playing games.

During that time, my nights out decreased a bit, but I often sneaked out to play until 2 AM while my family was asleep.

At that time, our local high school had a policy that allowed students with good grades to take part in an **Advanced Enrollment Examination**. If you passed, you wouldn't need to take the entrance exam. Fortunately, I was able to participate in this exam and successfully enroll in Second Middle School.

One night before the advanced exam, I snuck out to play CrossFire until after 3 AM, taking advantage of my mom sleeping. That time, I got caught red-handed; after arriving home, I found my mom waiting in the living room and, after a stern lecture, I promised to never sneak out at night again.

> Here’s a point to clarify: I’m aware of my own intelligence level; it’s pretty average! The main reason for my significant progress was that I had a solid foundation, especially in English and physics. My English was good because I liked it and had studied many middle school English topics in primary school. The situation with physics is interesting; although I didn’t pay much attention in physics class during my second year and didn’t understand it, I suddenly got it in my third year. Seriously! I still find it quite strange. Then, in high school, English and physics continued to be my two strongest subjects. During college, when I tutored, I taught high school physics.

## Dropped from Small Class to Regular Class in High School

![Photo Taken After Receiving Exam Results at My High School](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/internet-addiction-teenager/wodegaozhong.png)

Because I participated in the advanced enrollment examination, I entered high school four months early, starting in a small class where I began taking high school courses.

Once I got to high school, I secretly read novels during class, including "God’s Seal," "Douluo Continent," and "Battle Through the Heavens," among many others. In the afternoons and evenings when I returned home, I’d play a few rounds of DNF. My family had also bought a computer, a reward from my grandfather for successfully entering Second Middle School. By the time I uninstalled DNF, I had already leveled up four characters to max level, with two others nearing max level.

I had a specific album on my social media account that contained a collection of DNF photos and screenshots, as I was incredibly obsessed with leveling up and dungeon raids.

In less than a month in high school, I accidentally broke my leg during a PE class, feeling the pain of a broken bone for the first time—it was absolutely unbearable!

As a result, I had to take a break from school to recuperate. I didn’t return to school until a month after the official start of senior high, and I didn’t attend military training.

Since I had missed a few months of classes, I couldn’t go back to the small class and could only transfer to the Olympiad class. After joining the Olympiad class, I continued to invest my time and energy in games and novels, leading my grades to close to the bottom of the class. When the second-year evaluation came around, I was successfully dropped from the Olympiad class to the most ordinary regular class.

**I successfully played myself from the best small class to the Olympiad class and then back to the regular class. Quite surreal, right?**

## A Strong Comeback in Senior Year

I truly awakened academically in the second semester of senior year; I suddenly felt that games just weren’t appealing anymore, that DNF was no longer fun. Everything involving monster hunting and equipment grinding was just hollow; no matter how many max levels I achieved in DNF, it was meaningless without money.

My mom was surprised and curiously asked me, “Why aren’t you playing games anymore?” (She didn’t really mind me playing games; she believed it’s something that relies on self-discipline).

So, I began to study earnestly, immersing myself in learning (not exaggerating), and enjoying it. Even though I returned home around 11 PM after evening self-study sessions, I didn’t feel tired; instead, I felt happy and fulfilled.

**My efforts quickly paid off, and I successfully returned to the Olympiad class.** At that time, there were about seven science regular classes, and exam rankings were determined separately for these classes; we didn’t compete with the small and Olympiad classes for rankings. From then on, I was able to take first place in my regular class in almost every exam, often leading the second-place student by around 30 points. Given my outstanding grades, I applied to the head of our grade to return to the Olympiad class just before the first semester of senior year ended.

## Insomnia Before College Entrance Examination

> **After failure, don’t blame external factors; the problem has always been with yourself—not strong enough!** Likewise, the insomnia before my college entrance exam was also my own issue; if I have to point fingers, it’s only at myself—there’s no other outlet.

My college entrance exam experience was quite tumultuous. It’s no exaggeration to say that the days of the exam were the most challenging time I’ve experienced, especially at night.

During the few nights of the exam, I suffered from insomnia; the pain of being unable to sleep is something that many may have experienced.

Actually, I had never experienced insomnia before. On the eve of the college entrance exam, fearing I wouldn’t be able to sleep, I had my mom buy several bottles of the nerve-soothing tonic recommended by my teacher. I still remember the brand: Aodong.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/internet-addiction-teenager/image-20220625194714247.png)

The insomnia during the exam period might have been related to the tonic I drank, or perhaps I was too tense. Those nights, I felt as if many ants were crawling on me whenever I tried to sleep, and I broke out in some small hives (similar to an allergy).

Here’s something important to clarify to avoid misunderstandings: **Inability to sleep is a personal issue; none of the above statements are meant to blame the tonic.** Additionally, I’ve checked various platforms, and find that reviews for this tonic are quite favorable, similar to the reasons our teacher recommended it. If anyone needs help with sleep, you might consider consulting a doctor and giving it a try.

I indeed didn’t perform well on the college entrance exam, feeling like I was in a daze throughout. After the results were announced, I scored lower than I had predicted by several points and ultimately only got into a non-prestigious university. However, I was fortunate that I chose a good major and benefited from the computer science field during my university years, studying quite hard.

## College Life

My college life was quite rich. I would occasionally pull all-nighters coding or frantically head out at night with classmates to walk along the ancient city walls or spend the night in an internet café playing LOL.

I wrote a dedicated article about my college life: [Oh no, it’s been three years since graduation!](./my-college-life.md).

## Conclusion

Throughout middle school, I was somewhat of an internet-addicted teenager, but I was able to restrain myself a bit during the third year. It wasn’t until the second semester of senior year that I truly stopped being addicted to games.

My reduced obsession with games stemmed from the realization that games are ultimately just a pastime, and studying was the most important thing at that time. Besides, my gaming skills weren’t impressive, and I couldn’t make a living through gaming—everything concerning leveling up and monster hunting was merely binary data on a computer!

**This realization must come from within yourself; otherwise, relying solely on parental supervision is indeed very difficult to change! If your heart isn’t set on studying, it’s impossible to achieve good results!**

I strongly oppose overly intrusive parenting and vehemently denounce many parents who attribute their children's internet addiction to online games or blame media for their child’s violence.

**Constantly shielding your child isn’t a reliable solution; they will eventually face more and more temptations on their own. In university, many children who were overly protected by their parents end up failing. They lack independence and the strength to resist temptation!**
