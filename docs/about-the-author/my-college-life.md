> For insights into my middle and high school life, you can read the article [I Was Once a Teen Addicted to the Internet](./internet-addiction-teenager.md) that I wrote in 2020.

I graduated in June 2019, and it has been three years since then. With the college entrance examination and the graduation of fresh graduates happening, I want to briefly talk about my university life.

Here is the main text.

I graduated from Yangtze University in Jingzhou, an inconspicuous non-double first-class university.

I had a pretty happy four years of university life here, and I still miss it very much!

Overall, my life at school was quite colorful. I would occasionally stay up all night coding, and sometimes I would go out at midnight with classmates to walk along the ancient city wall or spend the night at an internet caf√© playing LOL.

I am writing this essay to document my past university life! I hope to continue to forge ahead in the future and not forget my original intention!

## Freshman Year

During my freshman year, I didn't focus my energy on learning programming; most of my time was spent participating in extracurricular activities.

Perhaps it was because I had come to a new city and was full of interest in everything around me. Or maybe it was because I was still quite naive at that time and had no clear direction for my studies.

That year, I went to many places in Jingzhou with a group of new classmates, such as the Jingzhou Museum, Yangtze River Bridge, Zhang Juzheng's Former Residence, and the Guandi Temple.

Even so, I was still full of hope for the future, looking forward to life after work.

I remember when we six roommates were chatting, the other five thought that finding a job with a salary of 6k would be quite good. I said, "At least it should be 8k!" They were speechless, thinking my idea was too naive.

In fact, I was thinking that it should start at a monthly salary of 10k, but I was too shy to say it directly.

I don't like to show off and have a somewhat introverted personality. When I first entered university, I was still a bit insecure, hesitant in everything I did, and I was eager to change myself!

So, with a passion, I tried many things I had never attempted before: **camping**, **outdoor barbecues**, **bus speeches**, **running around the ancient city wall**, **hiking**, **survival in a different place**, **selling apples on Christmas**, **performing at the New Year's Eve party**...

The following are things I did with my club friends during our spare time, and we sold out most of them during the week of Christmas. I remember we went to each dormitory to promote our sales.

I also participated in the New Year's Eve party in freshman year, but I still couldn't let go during the performance. To be honest, I felt I didn't show the flair I should have.

After this performance, I realized that I really didn't have a talent for acting; I was very stiff. Moreover, this stiffness and rigidity couldn't be changed even with effort.

The following picture was taken during a club dinner when I got a bit tipsy, captured by a friend.

At that time, I often went night walking on the ancient city wall with a few friends from the club.

I wonder how everyone from the club is doing now?

Although these experiences didn't help my future work
