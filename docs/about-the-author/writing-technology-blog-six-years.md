I have been坚持写技术博客已经有六年了，也算是一个小小的里程碑了。

At first, I wrote technical blogs just to summarize the courses I learned in class, such as networking and operating systems. Gradually, I started writing more systematic knowledge point explanations and summaries of common interview questions.

Many people want to write technical blogs but are unclear on the benefits it brings them. Some people begin writing technical blogs but don’t know how to persevere or what to write about. In this article, I will seriously discuss my views and insights on recording technical blogs, which may help you address these issues.

## What are the benefits of writing a technical blog?

### Better learning outcomes and deepening knowledge

You should already be familiar with the **Feynman Technique**, which is a very effective learning method that has been proven through practice. Named after the physicist Richard Feynman, who won a Nobel Prize in Physics and participated in the Manhattan Project, the Feynman Technique involves teaching a newly learned knowledge point as if you were a teacher: using the simplest and most straightforward words to explain complex and obscure knowledge, ideally avoiding technical jargon so that even those outside the field can understand it. To achieve this effect, imagine you are teaching an 80-year-old or an 8-year-old child.

Reading books or watching videos falls into passive learning, which is less effective. The Feynman Technique is an active learning method with excellent results.

**Writing a technical blog is essentially a way to teach others.** However, when recording a technical blog, it is okay to use technical terms (unless your audience is non-technical), but you need to express it in your own words, making it easy for others to understand. **Avoid copying from books or directly pasting other people's summaries!**

If we passively learn a knowledge point, most of the time we are only satisfied with the level of being able to use it; we do not delve into its principles, and many key concepts may not be fully understood.

When summarizing what you've learned into a blog, it will certainly deepen your thoughts on that knowledge point. Many times, in order to clearly explain a knowledge point, you will go back and research a lot of materials and even check a lot of source code. These small accumulations subtly enhance your understanding of the subject.

In fact, I often encounter this situation: **During the process of writing a blog, I suddenly realize that my understanding of a certain knowledge point is mistaken.**

**Writing a blog is itself a process of summarizing, reviewing, and reflecting on what you have learned. Documenting your blog is also a record of your learning journey. As time goes by and you grow older, is this not also a valuable mental asset?**

A friend from Knowledge Planet also mentioned that writing technical blogs helps improve one's knowledge system:

### Helping others while gaining a sense of accomplishment

Just like how we programmers hope our products can be recognized and liked by everyone, we also write technical blogs in part to gain recognition from others.

**When what you write helps others, you will feel a sense of achievement and happiness.**

![Reader recognition](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20230404181906257.png)

This sense of achievement and happiness serves as **positive feedback**, continuing to motivate you to write blogs.

However, even when receiving appreciation from many readers, you must remain humble and diligent in learning. There are many readers whose skills surpass yours, so stay open to learning!

Of course, you might receive a lot of criticism. Some may say your articles lack depth; others might comment that you are just idle, writing things that can be found online or in books.

**Face these criticisms calmly, do your own thing, and stay true to your path! Prove yourself through action!**

### There may be additional income

Writing a blog might also bring you financial rewards. It's the best scenario to provide value while also earning reasonable income!

Why do I say it may be? **Because currently, most people still find it difficult to earn income from blogging in the short term. I also don’t suggest that everyone starts writing blogs with the goal of making money; this kind of utilitarian approach might actually have the opposite effect. For example, if you persist for half a year and find no earnings, you may end up giving up.**

I started writing blogs in my sophomore year. In the second semester of my junior year, I began publishing my articles on WeChat public accounts, and it wasn't until the second semester of my senior year that I earned my first income from blogging.

My first income was earned through a promotional collaboration with a training institution on WeChat. If I remember correctly, this promotion brought me about **500** yuan. Though it's not a lot, it was very precious for me as a college student. At that time, I realized that writing could indeed be lucrative, which motivated me even more to share my writing. Unfortunately, after accepting two advertisements from this training institution, it went out of business.

After that, I went a long time without receiving any advertisements. Until NetEase reached out for a course collaboration, paying **1,000 yuan per article**, and I wrote nearly one article a month for almost two years. This became a relatively stable source of income for me during college.

Most of my old followers probably got to know me through the JavaGuide project, which I started preparing for job hunting interviews in my junior year. I didn't expect this project to become quite popular, even topping the GitHub rankings. Perhaps at that time, there were too few similar open-source documentation tutorial projects in the country, so the project's popularity was very high.

![JavaGuide Star Trends](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20230408131849198.png)

After the project gained traction, a large cloud service company in China contacted me, saying they wanted to sponsor the JavaGuide project. I was both surprised and delighted, worried that it might be a scam, and after confirming the contract multiple times, we ultimately agreed to add their company's banner to my project homepage for a monthly fee of 1,000 yuan.

As time went on, and after I wrote some popular articles that appealed to a wider audience, my blog’s visibility and income from blogging significantly increased as well.

### Increasing personal influence

Writing a technical blog is a way to showcase your technical skills and experience, allowing more people to understand your professional knowledge and skills. Consistently sharing high-quality technical articles will undoubtedly increase your personal influence in the tech field.

Having personal influence can be very helpful when looking for jobs, engaging in paid knowledge sharing, or publishing books later on.

Speaking of which, many well-known publishers have contacted me to discuss the writing of a book. Such opportunities are likely what many people dream of. However, I have turned them down one by one, feeling that I am far from being capable enough to write a book.

![Invitation from Electronics Industry Press to publish a book](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20230408121132211.png)

The main reason I don’t want to publish a book is that I find the whole process cumbersome; there is too much to handle. I tend to be a more laid-back person, and I don’t want to devote all my time to work.

## How can I persist in writing a technical blog?

**It is undeniable that people can be lazy by nature. We need a goal or motivation to push ourselves.**

For technical writing, your goals can be based on the quantity of technical articles, such as:

- How many technical articles to write in a year. I personally feel that setting goals over the timeframe of a year is too long and makes it hard to find a suitable goal.
- Outputting one high-quality technical article per month. This is relatively easier to achieve; one article a month means you will have twelve articles in a year, which is quite good.

However, setting goals based on the quantity of technical articles can be a bit utilitarian, and the quality of the articles is equally important. A high-quality technical article may take a week or even half a month of spare time to complete. You must avoid deliberately pursuing quantity while neglecting quality and losing sight of the essence of technical writing.

I have set a personal goal: **to write at least one original technical article or seriously revise and improve three past articles each month** (articles such as recommendations for open-source projects, learning experiences, personal experience sharing, interview experience sharing, etc., will not be counted).

My goal is relatively easy for me to complete, so I won’t brush off tasks just to meet the target. When I am in a good state and work isn’t too busy, I often exceed my tasks. The following image shows the tasks I completed in March of this year (task management tool: Microsoft To-Do). Aside from the gossip protocol written last year, the rest were completed in March.

If you feel that setting goals based on the number of articles is too utilitarian, you can write according to your own pace. However, in general, this approach may cause you to forget about it over time and lead to a growing aversion to blogging.

After finishing a technical article, we not only need to synchronize it to our blog but also distribute it to some common domestic technical communities like Blog Garden and Juejin. **The reason for distributing to other platforms is to gain attention and receive positive feedback (one source of motivation) and suggestions, which is a crucial step for persisting in technical writing; it must be emphasized!!!**

To be honest, there is a sense of happiness and accomplishment when you finish writing an article that you believe is decent. **However, pushing yourself to do this can be quite painful.** It’s like getting yourself to go out and have fun is easy; you can come up with various excuses to achieve that goal. But it requires external pressure to keep yourself dedicated to learning.

## What are some good directions to write blogs about?

In general, writing about the following directions will be more beneficial:

1. **Detailed explanation of a knowledge point**: It's essential to have your own thoughts rather than piecing together ideas. You need to introduce the basic concepts and principles of the knowledge point while integrating real-life cases and application scenarios for illustration.
1. **Problem troubleshooting/performance optimization experiences**: You need to detail the specific scenarios and solutions. It’s important to include sufficient descriptive details, such as the exact circumstances in which the problem arose, the root cause of the issue, and the thought process and specific steps that led to a solution. At the same time, focus on practicality and operability to help the reader learn and understand better.
1. **Source code reading notes**: Describe the low-level source code implementation starting from a functional point and discuss what you have learned from the source code.

Most importantly, pay attention to Markdown standards; otherwise, even the best content will appear unprofessional.

## Are there any writing tips to share?

### Keep sentences concise

Avoid long sentences; try to use short sentences (but don’t make them too short), as this makes them easier for readers to read and understand.

### Make the article more engaging and interesting

Try to make the article more vivid and interesting by incorporating illustrative examples, fun anecdotes, idioms, or trendy internet phrases.

However, this mainly depends on your writing style.

### Use simple and clear language

Avoid jargon or complex language that readers may not understand.

Focus on clarity and persuasiveness; keep it simple. Simple writing is persuasive—a good five-sentence argument will be more impactful than a hundred sentences of brilliant points. This is partly why proverbs and aphorisms are easily accepted: they are succinct and straightforward.

### Use visual effects

Charts, images, and other visual effects can make plain text content easier to understand. Remember to use visual elements appropriately to enhance the expressiveness of your article.

### Make technical article visuals bright

Below are two images with the same content, both created with draw.io. Which one do you prefer?

I believe most people will choose the latter, which has brighter colors!

Adjusting the colors took me less than 30 seconds, yet the improvement in reading experience was substantial!

### Identify your audience

Before writing, consider who your article's main audience is. Once you determine your audience, adjust your writing style and the difficulty of your content based on their needs and comprehension level.

### Review and edit

Make sure to review and edit your article before publishing it. This will help you catch errors, clarify any confusing information, and improve the overall quality of your document.

**Good articles come from revisions, don’t forget!!!**

## Conclusion

In summary, writing a technical blog is beneficial to both yourself and others. You may gain a lot from it, and what you write can also be of significant help to others. However, writing a technical blog can be quite time-consuming, and you need to balance it with work and life.
