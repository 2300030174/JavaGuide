On **December 29, 2019**, after about a year of hesitation, I officially decided to start my own planet to help students learn Java and prepare for Java interviews. In the blink of an eye, it has been over four years. Thank you all for your support along the way. I will keep my promise and continue to diligently maintain this pure Java knowledge planet, ensuring that my readers who trust me are not disappointed.

I was among the early batch of technical account holders to create a planet, and I am also one of the few who have persisted (most bloggers cash out quickly and stop maintaining their planets). In the first couple of years, it was purely driven by passion. The initial pricing was very low (the cost of a meal), and since I was busy with my job, the services provided were not as extensive as they are now.

Gradually, the price increased, and the income from the planet has indeed risen slowly. However, considering that my audience mainly consists of students, the pricing is still much lower than similar planets. Additionally, I have no plans to create a training camp, even though a training camp could earn me more money given my traffic.

**I have my principles: I won't exploit anyone, I focus on creating quality content, and I sincerely hope to help others!**

## What is a Knowledge Planet?

In simple terms, a Knowledge Planet is a private communication circle, primarily used for knowledge creators to connect with their loyal readers/fans. Compared to WeChat groups, the content on a Knowledge Planet is more organized and information management is more efficient.
