If you have read my previous introduction, you would know that I am one of the millions of graduates from 2019. This article mainly discusses my feelings after working for more than half a year. There are many subjective feelings in this text, and if you disagree with any part, feel free to express your thoughts in the comments; I will respect others' opinions.

Let me briefly introduce my situation! I am currently working at a foreign company, and like most people, my daily work involves development. Since graduation, I have been working for about six months and have already passed the company's six-month probation period. I have worked on two projects that are more business-oriented, one of which is still ongoing. You might find it hard to believe that the backends of both business projects I worked on did not involve distributed/microservices, nor did I have the opportunity to work with "high-end" technologies like Redis or Kafka in practical applications.

The first project was an internal project of the company—an employee growth system. Aside from the name, this system is essentially for performance evaluation, such as assessing your performance in a project team. The technologies used in this project are Spring Boot + JPA + Spring Security + K8S + Docker + React. The second project I am currently working on is an integrated project involving a game (Cocos), a web management backend (Spring Boot + Vue), and a mini-program (Taro).

Yes, most of my time at work is related to CRUD operations, and I also write frontend pages daily. A friend of mine was quite puzzled when he heard that most of my project work involved writing business code. He thought that simply writing business code wouldn't lead to improvement. What? You, a fresh graduate, can't even write business code well, and you say this! So, **I am quite puzzled as to why many people who can't even write business code feel disgusted when they hear CRUD? At least I feel that during my time at work, my code quality has improved, my problem-solving skills have significantly enhanced, and I have gained a deeper understanding of the business, allowing me to independently complete some frontend development.**

In fact, I personally believe that writing good business code is not that easy. Before complaining about doing CRUD work every day, take a look at whether your CRUD code is well-written. In other words, during the process of writing CRUD, did you understand the commonly used annotations or classes? It's like someone who only knows the simplest annotations like `@Service`, `@Autowired`, `@RestController`, etc., claiming they have mastered Spring Boot.

I don't know when it started, but everyone seems to think that having practical experience with Redis or MQ is impressive, which may be related to the current interview environment. You need to differentiate yourself from others; if you want to enter a big company, it seems you must be proficient in these technologies. Well, there’s no "seems" about it; confidently speaking, for most job seekers, these technologies are considered essential.

**To be honest, I fell into this "false proposition" during my university years.** In college, I was introduced to Java in my sophomore year after joining a school media organization focused on technology, and our goal was to develop a campus app. At that time, I was just starting to learn Java and spent some time mastering the basics. Then, I began learning Android development.

By the first semester of my junior year, I had truly decided to pursue a career in Java backend development and started looking for Java backend jobs. After about three months of learning the basics of web development, I began studying distributed technologies like Redis and Dubbo. I learned through books, videos, and blogs, and during my self-study, I completed two full projects: a regular business system and a distributed system. **I thought I was impressive after finishing those projects, and I felt that ordinary CRUD work was beneath my current level. Haha! Looking back now, I realize I was overly optimistic!**

Sure enough! Problems arose when I worked on a project with my teacher during the summer of my junior year. We were working on a performance evaluation system, which had a moderate level of complexity. The technologies used for this project were SSM + Shiro + JSP. During this project, I encountered various issues, and I found that I couldn't write the code I thought I could; even writing a simple CRUD operation took me several days. So, at that time, I was studying, learning, and coding all at once. Although it was exhausting, I learned a lot and became more grounded in my technical skills. I felt that the statement "this project has no possibility of maintenance" was my biggest denial of the project I worked on.

Technology is ever-changing, and mastering the core aspects is key. A few years ago, we might have been using Spring based on traditional XML development, but now almost everyone uses
