Plagiarists are really annoying...

I heard from friends that my article was stolen on Zhihu again, used by someone else to drive traffic without any modifications.

And!!! This is not even the worst part.

The person even cited an original source at the end of the article, but it wasn't mine...

This means that some other plagiarist on CSDN stole my article and claimed it as original, and the plagiarist on Zhihu directly copied this CSDN plagiarist's article.

It's truly outrageous, like opening the door to absurdity, it's absurd to the extreme.

I opened the original source link indicated by the Zhihu plagiarist, and wow, the content is identical, and it claims originality.

After looking at this CSDN plagiarist's article, wow, they have copied my highly upvoted answer in its entirety... Truly diligent...

I don't want to say much about CSDN; it's just a large garbage dump of articles filled with various unregulated reprints and all kinds of text that require payment to download. This site, which claims to be the largest tech site in the country, is disgusting, very unpleasant to deal with, so it's better not to use it!

When I usually search on Google, I directly block the CSDN site. You just need to download a Chrome extension called Personal Blocklist and add blog.csdn.net to your blacklist.

Basically, my article has been completely stolen, and the key is that I don't get much traffic from my own posts, while those who steal my articles have more traffic than I do as the original author.

What kind of world is this? Is it a distortion of human nature or a decline in morality?

But, it's okay, it's not a problem if I don't publish on this garbage site CSDN.

If you look at the articles on the hot list of CSDN, you will see that they are all garbage; they are either various ads or nonsensical patchwork articles.

Of course, there are a very small number of high-quality articles, such as those by bloggers like Tao Ge, Er Ge, Bing He, and Micro Technology.

There are also many bloggers on various video platforms (like Douyin and Bilibili) who directly use others' original content to make videos for traffic or followers.

The article that has been stolen today was once taken by a training institution and turned into a video for traffic purposes.

As an individual, I have no way to stop it, I can only report them one by one...
