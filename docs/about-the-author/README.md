In this article, I will briefly introduce myself in a Q&A format.

## When did I graduate?

Many long-time readers should be familiar with the fact that I graduated in 2019 and immediately went to work at a foreign company.

My school background is not great; I barely passed the college entrance examination with about 20 points above the cutoff for the first-tier universities, and I went to a very ordinary non-project first-tier university in Jingzhou. However, I am glad that I did not give up on myself because of my school. Instead, I worked harder than my classmates and had a relatively fulfilling university life.

The photo below is from my graduation ceremony (I'm in the middle of the back row):

## How long have I been blogging?

Time flies! I started writing my blog in my sophomore year. At that time, I casually shared my study notes and programs I wrote on a blogging platform. For example, [Professor Xie Xiren's Summary of "Computer Networks"](../cs-basics/network/computer-network-xiexiren-summary.md) is an article I summed up while studying the computer networks course in my sophomore year by referring to the textbook.

Many of my friends often ask me, "Is it too late for me to start blogging now?"

I think! If you want to do something, try to ask yourself if it‚Äôs worth it rather than if it's too late. As long as you feel it's meaningful, just start doing it as soon as possible! Life is wonderful, and every significant decision we make will affect our future trajectories. Whether it‚Äôs good or bad, only we ourselves will know!

For me personally, the decision to stick to blogging has had a very positive impact on my life trajectory! Therefore, I also recommend everyone to develop the habit of consistently writing blogs.

## How much money did I earn during college?

During my time at school, I managed to make over 200,000 through running tutoring sessions, taking freelance jobs, technical training, and programming competitions, achieving "economic independence." I used the money I earned to travel to places like Chongqing, Sanya, Enshi, and Qingdao, and I also contributed a lot to my family to ease my parents' burden.

The photo below was taken when I was running a tutoring class in my first year of college (the last meal before leaving):

The photo below was taken when I went to Sanya in my junior year:

Actually, I started working so hard to earn money in college mainly because my family conditions were quite average, and my parents worked very hard to earn a living! It was precisely because I desperately wanted to lessen my parents' burden that I tried so many ways to earn money.

I have noticed that many people in our programming field come from average families, and a significant reason for choosing this industry is not because they like it, but to earn more money.

If you also want to earn money through freelance jobs, you can reply "**Freelance**" in the backend of my WeChat public account to learn some personal experience I share.

## Why do I call myself Guide?

Perhaps it's because my project is named JavaGuide, which has led many people to call me **Guide Brother**.

Later, to make it easier for readers to address me, I changed my pen name to **Guide**.

My early pen name was SnailClimb. Many people do not know what this name means, so let me explain it. SnailClimb = Snail (ËúóÁâõ) + Climb (ÊîÄÁôª). I have loved listening to Jay Chou's songs since I was young, especially his song "Snail" üêå. Furthermore, I did not perform well in the college entrance examination, and after entering university, I was relatively ‚Äúambitious,‚Äù so I named myself SnailClimb, meaning I want to keep climbing upwards. Hehe üòÅ

## Postscript

Wherever the heart desires, the feet must follow; life is like a journey against the current, where we sail with a single reed.

Life indeed has its bittersweet moments. Let‚Äôs encourage each other!
