## Does JavaGuide support RSS?

It definitely does! I recommend subscribing to the RSS feed of this website to receive the latest updates.

## Is there a PDF version of JavaGuide?

Since the content of JavaGuide is continuously being improved, there is currently no fully synchronized PDF version available. If you want a PDF version, you might consider **"JavaGuide Interview Crash Course"**, which is a condensed summary of JavaGuide's content.

You can get the "JavaGuide Interview Crash Course" by replying with "**PDF**" in the backend of my public account, it’s free. In addition to "JavaGuide Interview Crash Course," you will also receive several high-quality interview PDF manuals for free.

## What do you think about the high number of stars on JavaGuide?

[JavaGuide](https://github.com/Snailclimb) is currently one of the projects with the most stars in the Java field, having topped GitHub Trending many times.

However, there's really no point in boasting about it. The value of tutorial content is relatively low, and the high star count is mainly because of the broad audience; people find it useful and star it as a way of bookmarking. Many outstanding frameworks may have only a few thousand stars. So, looking solely at the star count isn’t meaningful; you might as well take it as a joke!

During the maintenance of this project, some people have also diss'ed it: "This is an MD project with no real value; it’s embarrassing for the Chinese!"

To those who say such things, I feel it doesn't affect me much; I'll just keep improving and make JavaGuide better! In fact, many foreign projects are purely MD too! For example, the awesome series and job interview series initiated by friends overseas. No need to say more, actions speak for themselves!

An essential aspect of open source is collaboration. If you open source a project but stop maintaining it, and you don't process the issues/pr submitted by others, then open sourcing becomes meaningless!

## Will JavaGuide publish a printed book?

I can give a relatively clear answer: **There are currently no plans to publish a book**.

About a year after the project started, I was contacted by a publisher; however, realizing that my personal abilities needed further refinement, I declined the offer. In recent years, as the project gained some notoriety, more publishers have approached me for book deals, but I have respectfully declined all of them.

**Publishing a book can enhance reputation and earn some money, so why don't I consider it?**

- There’s a lot of content in JavaGuide that I am not fully satisfied with and it is still being maintained. Attentive partners can see my [commit history](https://github.com/Snailclimb/JavaGuide/commits/main).
- The open-source version is easier to maintain and modify, and it allows more people to conveniently participate in the project's development, which was my initial motivation for starting this project.
- I believe that publishing a book is a sacred act, and I admit that my abilities are not sufficient yet.
- My personal energy is limited; I not only have my main job but have also started a [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) to earn some extra income while also maintaining and improving JavaGuide.
- …

Over the past few years, I have been quietly refining the project and sincerely hope that JavaGuide will continue to improve and help more friends! I also welcome everyone to participate!

## Why are there some paid articles on JavaGuide?

Indeed, there are very few paid articles on JavaGuide, less than about 10, which is negligible compared to the overall content of the site.

These paid articles are exclusive to [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) and are used by me to drive traffic to Knowledge Planet; they do not have much impact on the overall reading experience.

I also understand that people dislike marketing, so I will make sure to keep it within a reasonable limit. I neither exploit people nor sell anxiety; I am just trying to earn a small amount to improve my family's quality of life.

**I am committed to creating valuable content and sincerely hope it can help others.**
