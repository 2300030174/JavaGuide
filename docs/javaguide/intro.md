I graduated from university in 2019. While preparing for interviews in my junior year, I open-sourced JavaGuide. I shared my insights and summaries from my interview preparation process through JavaGuide without reservation.

The initial idea behind open-sourcing JavaGuide came from my own somewhat confusing learning experience. The main purpose is to use this open-source platform to help those who encounter problems while learning Java or preparing for interviews.

- **For Java beginners:** This document aims to provide you with a relatively detailed learning path, with a clear table of contents, giving you a concise understanding of the overall knowledge system of Java. You can follow along with videos or books to learn specific concepts, and then come here to find the corresponding summaries to help you better grasp those knowledge points.
- **For non-beginners in Java:** This document is more suitable for reviewing knowledge and preparing for interviews, helping you identify which topics to focus on during interviews.

**Since the content of this website is completely open-source and maintained by everyone, the content quality is relatively high.** If you also want to participate in the maintenance and development of JavaGuide, please refer to the [Contribution Guidelines](./contribution-guideline.md).

Compared to others who learned from JavaGuide or found job offers thanks to it, JavaGuide means even more to me. To be honest, sometimes it really feels like watching my own child grow little by little, and I have always nurtured it with care. Although I have spent a long time maintaining it, I feel it is absolutely worth it! It is very meaningful!

However, I hope everyone will not harbor any delusions about interviews; hard work is essential! **I hope this document guides you in learning Java, and is not just something to use to cope with interviews.**

Additionally, JavaGuide cannot cover all interview content, especially for companies like Alibaba and Meituan, which delve deeply into interviews. You can conduct targeted in-depth learning based on your target companies, read more interview experiences from those companies to identify any gaps, and self-test occasionally to think and summarize more.

Keep it up! Oli Give!

## Official Knowledge Planet

For those preparing for interviews, I highly recommend a purely [Java Interview Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md) that I created, which contains a lot of valuable content and has a great learning atmosphere!

Here are some of the services provided by the planet (click the image below to get detailed information about the Knowledge Planet):

## Project Description

- The [Online Reading Website](https://javaguide.cn) is built based on Vuepress, using the theme [vuepress-theme-hope](https://github.com/vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope) (a very nice theme).
- The Markdown format of the project refers to: [GitHub Markdown Format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and the emoticon materials come from: [EMOJI CHEAT SHEET](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).
- The small icon under the logo is generated using [Shields.IO](https://shields.io/).
