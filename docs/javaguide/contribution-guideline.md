Welcome to participate in the maintenance of JavaGuide, which is a very meaningful endeavor. For more details, please see: [JavaGuide Contribution Guide](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/464832264).

You can contribute in the following ways:

- Correct typos, as the content is mostly typed by hand, and errors are inevitable.
- Modify and improve existing content, such as enhancing the answers to specific interview questions or refining the content of an article.
- Add new content, such as frequently asked interview questions or detailed explanations of important knowledge points.

Currently, the contribution rewards are quite rich and comprehensive. For users who contribute multiple times, there are physical rewards like headphones and keyboards, as well as cash rewards!

Please pay close attention to **formatting standards**:

If you want to raise an issue or question, it is highly recommended to read the following materials:

- [The Art of Asking Questions](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way)
- [How to Ask Questions in Open Source Communities](https://github.com/seajs/seajs/issues/545)
- [How to Effectively Report Bugs](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs-cn.html)
- [How to Submit Unanswerable Questions to Open Source Projects](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25795393).

Additionally, you can refer to and learn from others' articles, but you must absolutely not copy and paste others' content. Strive to write in a way that is easier to understand than what others have written, express it in your own words, simplify appropriately, and highlight the key points!
