To help more students prepare for Java interviews and learn Java, I have created a pure [Java Interview Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md). Although the fee is only one percent of that of training classes/bootcamps, the content quality in the Knowledge Planet is higher, and the services provided are more comprehensive, making it very suitable for students preparing for Java interviews and learning Java.

**Students preparing for Java interviews and learning Java are welcome to join my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md). There is a lot of valuable content, and the learning atmosphere is quite good! Although the fee is inexpensive, the content in the planet may be of higher quality than attending expensive training classes.**
